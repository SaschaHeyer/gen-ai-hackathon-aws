But text speak has not been the disaster for language many feared and one leading linguist has claimed it actually improves people's writing and spelling. Professor David Crystal, an honorary professor at Bangor University, said those who text regularly were found to be 'concentrating their minds' on the relationship between sounds and  written words. The linguist, who has written more than 100 books on the English language, pointed out a new generation is 'constantly' reading and writing online. 'People say text messaging will harm your spelling. No...It helps you to spell better,' he said at the Emirates Airline Festival of Literature in Dubai according to the Daily Telegraph. 'This is because it focuses your mind on the connection between sound and letters. 'The best texters are the best spellers. 'People say young people don't read and write any more.'They may not necessarily read... Shakespeare or Charles Dickens, but have you ever seen a teenager not reading? 'Young people read probably more than I did when I was that age.' He said the digital age had not necessarily heralded a 'linguistic revolution' in the way critics had predicted and said the 'moral panic' of the potential change has not been justified. Professor Crystal's studies have found around 2,000 new words developed as a result of the digital age, including terms such as blog and twittersphere. He said  additions have so far not had a major, or negative, impact on the English language, which has more than one million  words. The linguist said many abbreviations such as 'c u l8r' are not commonly used by modern teenagers. Professor Crystal also claimed that hashtags, used on Twitter, are simply a new method of managing and classifying information and were likely to stay. Professor David Crystal dismissed claims youngsters were not reading as much today as they had done in the past . His comments dispel previous claims abbreviated language was worsening teenagers' grasp of the English language. In 2012 a study claimed the grammar standards of school pupils aged 10-12 had slipped as a result of constantly using shortened phrases. Researchers urged parents not to communicate with their children in text speak to avoid their abilities suffering more. Last year it was claimed Britons spent more time using mobile phones, computers and handheld tablets than they did sleeping. Information gathered by Ofcom, the television watchdog, found the average adult slept for eight hours 21 minutes but spent 20 minutes longer connected to technology."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Professor David Crystal said texting improves people's writing and spelling .\nYoungsters are 'reading more than ever because they're glued to screens'\nThose constantly texting are 'concentrating' on words and sounds, he said ."}]}

As England walked out to play Scotland yesterday evening, it said there were 180 days to go. Everything England do in this Six Nations is being seen through the prism of their prospects in the tournament which will start here at Twickenham on September 18 with their opener against Fiji. When Stuart Lancaster’s side failed their biggest test of this competition, slumping to a shattering 19-9 loss to Ireland at the Aviva Stadium a fortnight ago, many observers said the rest of the Six Nations was redundant for them. Exeter wing Jack Nowell crosses over to score England's third try and send them top of the Six Nations table . Ben Youngs hands off a tackle as England recovered from a half-time deficit to win at Twickenham . VIDEO O2 Inside Line: England v Scotland match review . They said that the match against Ireland was the only game that could tell us whether England were making significant progress in the build-up to the World Cup and nothing that happened in their last two games against France or Scotland mattered. They were damned for the manner of their defeat, of course. Unflattering comparisons were drawn with where this side stands six months before the World Cup to the level Clive Woodward’s side had reached at the same stage prior to the 2003 tournament. ‘Based on their performances in the Six Nations, England are running the risk of being labelled the most foolish team in the competition,’ England World Cup winner Will Greenwood wrote. ‘England need to play with tempo, yes, but they need to do it with their rugby brains fully engaged and that is not what they have been doing at key moments.’ England won the game but they haven't shown enough to convince yet during the Six Nations . Mike Brown was one of the better performers but England spurned too many opportunities at Twickenham . Despite the predictions, though, Saturday's battle for the Calcutta Cup told us plenty about England’s prospects in the autumn. It wasn’t all good by any means. In fact, the evidence of an exhilarating first half suggested again that England are still short of the standard they have to achieve to be realistic contenders for the World Cup. It felt like a wasted opportunity. Despite concerns that the match had not sold out, the atmosphere at Twickenham had been bolstered by the scenes playing on the screens inside and outside the stadium from Cardiff where Wales’ victory over Ireland put England back in with a chance of winning the Six Nations. When England tore Scotland apart in the opening minutes, it felt as if this could yet be the game that ignited their confidence and laid the foundation for future success. That feeling did not last for long. George Ford got England off to a perfect start in the second-half but the first half will have worried them . The England squad smile for the cameras having defeated Scotland 25-13 to win the Calcutta Cup . Defeating Scotland however will not lead the top nations to fear England, and time is running out . England were not ruthless enough in attack. They squandered chance after chance to convert breakaways, eschewing easy passes, making the wrong decisions. They should have scored four tries before half-time but they were limited to Jonathan Joseph’s score after a neat sidestep five minutes into the game. It seemed then as if England were about to embark on the points rampage that would put them in prime position ahead of the final fixtures of the competition next weekend. That rampage did not materialise. Instead, Scotland came back into the game and more doubts began to surface about England. This time, it was their defence which suffered in comparison to the heroic efforts of the Welsh earlier in the day. Mark Bennett bulldozed his way over for a score with Scotland’s first chance of the game midway through the half. Twickenham may still be a formidable place to get a result, but England are not unbeatable there . Tom Youngs (centre) leads an England breakaway as Lancaster's side returned to the Six Nations summit . England allowed Scotland back into the game too easily, and they lack momentum heading to the World Cup . Scotland actually led 13-10 at the interval. Their supporters began to dream of a first victory at Twickenham for 32 years. It was hardly the response to the defeat in Dublin that Lancaster was looking for. ‘England need to be careful out there or they could end up with real egg on their face,’ Woodward said at half-time. England banished that idea when George Ford burst over for a try three minutes into the second half but, even though Scotland never threatened again, England remained unconvincing. There were times when they seemed to be trying to set a new record for ways in which they could ruin their good work. Anthony Watson runs clear but England repeatedly failed to take their chances at Twickenham on Saturday . Twice they had tries ruled out for forward passes. A late score in the corner from Jack Nowell put a healthier gloss on the result but they will only take a four-point advantage over Ireland into the deciding weekend. It should have been more and when the final whistle went, it was met only by lukewarm applause. Sure, England may yet win the Six Nations next Saturday but the truth is that there is no sense of momentum about their build-up to the World Cup. There are moments when they excite, certainly, but there are times when they bewilder, too. The suspicion remains that even here at Twickenham, the best in the world will be too much for them in the autumn. And all the time, that clock in the old RFU headquarters keeps on counting down."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "England beat Scotland 25-13 at Twickenham but missed several chances .\nThe biggest test for Stuart Lancaster's side came in defeat by Ireland .\nBut even after setback, England had chance to lay down a marker .\nEven if England win Six Nations, they will not take momentum into autumn .\nTop teams will still feel England are beatable, even at Twickenham ."}]}

Alicia Carroll, of Garland, faces a charge of abandoning and endangering a child. The 28-year-old remained in Dallas County Jail Monday on $25,000 bond. Police say Carroll called police Sunday morning saying the person she left her daughter with on Saturday night would not return the child. Bad parenting: Alicia Carroll, 28, has been charged with child endangerment after Dallas police say she made her daughter sleep alone in a dumpster . But according to police documents, the 7-year-old girl said her mother told her to 'hide' in the trash bin after the two exited the popular King Spa and Sauna on Royal Lane. Officers found the little girl 10 hours later after being flagged down by citizens who saw her looking filthy and barefoot. When she was interviewed by police, Miss Carroll said she had been drinking at the spa and at around 10pm stepped out to 'clear her head,' leaving her daughter inside with an acquaintance, reported Dallas Morning News. However, a King Spa worker told NBC 5 that the mother and daughter left the establishment together after attending a party with friends. When police finally caught up with the 7-year-old girl at around 11.15am Sunday, she told them that when she and her mother left the spa, Carroll suddenly took off running. The child claimed that Carroll told her they were being pursued by police and had to go into hiding. According to investigators, Carroll then placed her daughter in a garbage container in a 'high-crime' area and fled. The little girl eventually fell asleep amid refuse and woke up only 10 hours later. She was able to scramble out of the dumpster and began walking down Royal Lane towards the spa. Passersby spotted her on the street walking without shoes and called police. Officers who responded to the scene described the child as thirsty, hungry, and covered in filth and cuts to her arms and legs.

Excuse: The 28-year-old initially told police she had left her daughter with an acquaintance so she could 'clear her head' who then refused to give the child back . When pressed about the incident, Alicia Carroll admitted that she became inebriated after downing two vodka drinks in the spa parking lot and did not remember after happened later. Carroll returned to the spa at around 9.45am the following day looking for her daughter, but the child was not there and employees could not tell her where she’d gone. The mother then called police, setting off a frantic ground and air search, which ended when a Good Samaritan called them to report seeing the girl wandering down Royal Lane. The 7-year-old victim was released into the custody of a relative after undergoing a medical evaluation."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Alicia Carroll, 28, charged with child endangerment in Dallas .\nPolice say Carroll got drunk on vodka and forced her 7-year-old to 'hide' in a dumpster .\nThe girl slept in the trash bin for 10 hours and was later spotted wandering barefoot near King Spa and Sauna .\nCarroll initially told police she had left her daughter with an acquaintance who then refused to give the child back ."}]}

Starc's worth to the Australian team was never more evident than when he dismissed New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum in the first over of Sunday's final. The New Zealand innings never fully recovered and Australia went on to claim an emphatic seven-wicket victory. Few could have predicted the impact Starc would make at this tournament back in December when the left-arm swing bowler returned figures of 2-110 in the second Test against India in Brisbane, leading Shane Warne to describe Starc's body language as 'soft.' Australia seam bowler Mitchell Starc has been named man of the tournament at the Cricket World Cup . Starc celebrates after taking the wicket of New Zealand batsman Brendon McCullum in the final . The Australia team celebrate with the trophy after being crowned world champions in Melbourne . The 25-year-old Starc was subsequently dropped for the Boxing Day Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, the same venue where on Sunday he was named player of the tournament after using a new-found aggression to snare 22 wickets throughout the World Cup. 'I've worked really hard at it for a number of months now with (bowling coach) Craig McDermott in the background,' Starc said. 'A few series ago we sat down and found out a little plan and to see that come to fruition has been phenomenal.' He said his game-changing dismissal of McCullum off just the fifth ball of the final was part luck and part planning. Shane Warne, who had dismissed Starc as 'soft' before the tournament, poses with captain Michael Clarke . 'There was a lot of luck involved I think, but it was a little plan that Craig and I had going a couple of days ago,' he said. 'Brendon has been really fantastic through the whole tournament so I think there was a lot of luck involved. I'm just happy to get that one.' After a tournament notable for batting performances - including two double centuries, and teams regularly passing 300 runs, it was fitting that one of the few bowlers able to consistently make life difficult for the batsmen to win the coveted award. 'It was an amazing tournament and some outstanding performances,' Starc said. 'New Zealand has been a great team throughout the tournament and even set the benchmark, but I think we came hard today and (that) really led to this performance.'

Bad weather  prevented the recovery of bodies and the flight recorder from the wreckage on Thursday, and while the military had not officially released any times, loved one of those on the doomed copter did speak with the press.. Now however, the names and identities of the seven Marines have been revealed. Scroll down for video . Crews lower a piece of a Black Hawk helicopter onto a barge in the Santa Rosa Sound near Pritchard Point in Florida . Staff Sgt. Andrew C. Seif (left) and Staff Sgt. Trevor P. Blaylock (right) Staff Sgt. Andrew C. Seif was a Silver Star Medal recipient who received the award for facing enemy fire to save a mortally wounded friend in Afghanistan in July 2012. He was born in Fairbanks, Alaska, and lived in Albuquerque, New Mexico, until middle-school when his family moved to Holland, Michigan, the Marines said. Seif, 26, grew up playing soldier in his backyard and joined the Marines just weeks after graduating from high school, according to an article about his award published this week in the Camp Lejeune Globe, the post newspaper. By 2012, he had spent two years as a special forces operator with the 2nd Marine Special Operations Battalion, which operates from the Middle East to Central Asia. Seif and his teammate, Sgt. Justin Hansen, were closing in on one of western Afghanistan's bomb experts, according to the paper. They came under fire, and Hansen was hit. Seif moved Hansen to safer position and treated his teammate's wounds. Seif returned fire, advanced alone across the compound and found the targeted bomb-maker. 'The fact that (Seif) continued to fight through the objective to get Sgt. Hansen taken care of, putting himself in the line of fire, speaks volumes to who he is and demonstrates that he would never leave a Marine behind,' said Maj. Gen. Joseph L. Osterman. Seif's wife was at his side when he received the medal. Staff Sgt. Trevor P. Blaylock, 29, was born in Lake Orion, Michigan, and swam on the varsity swim team. He attended Henry Ford Community College for one year before joining the Marine Corps in 2006. Initially, he was a mechanic in an armored reconnaissance battalion at Camp Pendleton in California. He served two tours in Iraq in 2007 and 2008. His decorations include the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal with Valor. His home near Camp Lejeune was within earshot of dull booming sounds of artillery or other heavy weapons. Master Sgt. Thomas A. Saunders (left) and Staff Sgt. Liam Flynn (right) Born in Bonn, Germany, Master Sgt. Thomas A. Saunders, 33, enlisted in the Marines after graduating from high school in Virginia. Following basic training in 1999, he was assigned to Camp LeJeune. He deployed to Kosovo and served with special operations teams in Iraq and Afghanistan before years before joining a Marine Corps special operations unit in 2010. He spent eight months as a liaison to Army Special Operations Command before joining his Middle East-focused regiment four years ago. He was married to a fellow Marine based at Camp Lejeune, and the couple has one son, according to an award by the Marine Corps Association & Foundation naming Saunders its special forces operator of 2014. Born in Reading, England, Staff Sgt. Liam Flynn, 33, moved to Queens, New York in 2002. He enlisted in the Marine Corps in 2006. After boot camp, he was assigned to Camp Lejeune. He served tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan before joining the Marine Corps' special operations force in 2011 and returning to Afghanistan in 2012. Flynn's heroism was honored by receiving three Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medals with Valor and the Bronze Star with Valor. Capt. Stanford Henry Shaw III (left) and Staff Sgt. Marcus S. Bawol (right) Capt. Stanford Henry Shaw III, 31, was from Basking Ridge, New Jersey, and attended Ridge High School, where he was student government president and captain of the varsity lacrosse team. He attended the United States Naval Academy and became a commissioned Marine officer upon graduation in 2006. He graduated from the Infantry Officer Course and was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 7th Marines. He served two tours of duty in Iraq in 2007 and 2009, according to information provided by the Marines at Camp Lejeune. His career took him to Japan, where he became the deputy camp commander of a jungle warfare training center on Okinawa in 2011. He graduated from the Malaysian army's jungle warfare course and then joined the Marine special forces. Staff Sgt. Marcus S. Bawol of Warren, Michigan, \"loved everything about the military,\" said his sister, Brandy Peek. 'He couldn't wait to join. He wanted to fight for our country and was always striving to be the best Marine he could be,' Peek said. The 27-year-old graduated in 2006 from Warren Mott High School. Bawol played baseball and football and was a member of the school's swim team, according to district Superintendent Robert Livernois. Bawol attended Olivet College for a year, where he was a catcher on the baseball team. He had planned to marry his fiancée in October, Peek said.

Debris: Pentagon officials say the 11 on board are presumed and that the mission is now one of search and recover . Staff Sgt. Kerry Michael Kemp, 27, was the proud father of a baby just shy of her first birthday and loved horsing around with his nephews. 'He would wrestle with them. He really got into that, the wrestling and playing. He'd carry them around on his back,' said his sister-in-law, Lora Waraksa. He was a \"proud Marine, a loving husband and most wonderful father,\" she said. He also loved golfing and the ocean — he often took his nephews out to hunt for sea shells. Born in Memphis, Tennessee, Kemp met his wife, Jenna, at Port Washington High School in Wisconsin, where he was voted \"best smile\" by his senior class. He graduated in 2005. He started as an artillery mechanic, and his military merit led to three quick promotions. He completed training in special operations in 2012 and spent seven months in Afghanistan before returning in June. Meanwhile, divers have found the wreckage of the military helicopter in just 25 feet of water. A small memorial stands in the sand along Highway 98 in Navarre, Florida . 'It was certainly a high-impact crash,' said Eglin Fire Chief Mark Giuliano, and 'very, very, very dense fog' was complicating the response. There's almost no visibility at the spot where the wreckage was found, forcing search crews to move slowly to avoid colliding with each other, and the surf is too rough still to pull the wreckage to the surface. Dozens of airmen walked the shores of Santa Rosa Sound Thursday, recovering pieces of clothing and bits of wreckage, but the U.S. Coast Guard suspended its search Thursday afternoon, and will instead focus on helping the Army recover the remaining fuselage and debris, it said. President Barack Obama has promised a thorough investigation into the cause, which is being led by the U.S. Army Combat Readiness Center out of Fort Rucker, Alabama. The helicopter went down Tuesday night in fog so thick that another helicopter turned back. American flags stand in the median near the bridge entrance to Navarre Beach, Florida . A woman at campground nearby, Kim Urr, said she heard a metallic sound and then two muffled explosions as it disappeared into the narrow waterway separating Santa Rosa Island from the Florida panhandle mainland. This dense sea fog, which could persist through Friday, is common when warm southern air meets cold water this time of year, said Jack Cullen, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Mobile, Alabama. The same fog enveloped a large gathering holding a vigil on a pier Wednesday night. Crashing Gulf waves created a somber backdrop to the songs, tears and prayers of the people, who have strong ties to the military and the sprawling Eglin Air Force Base.

A New Jersey student with a bad cold was locked in a hospital psych ward for six days after going to her university's heath center for a medication to treat flu-like symptoms, she alleges in a lawsuit. Kaitlin Taylor, of Union County, New Jersey, went to the campus health center at Syracuse  - a school she's since left - when she was a sophomore in September 2013 complaining of flu-like symptoms. But the six-day stay in the nearby St Joseph's Hospital was not what she was expecting when she told the center's staff that she was suffering from a fever, cough, phlegm and chest congestion. While waiting for care, Taylor said she told a counselor that she wanted to change her arts major and take a leave of absence from the school but missed the semester's deadline because her computer was stolen. When she was told no one could write her a prescription at the center, she was driven to St Joseph's and dropped in front the the emergency room, according to the New York Post. While waiting in the ER, Taylor said she felt as though she was getting sicker. 'I was getting stressed by the circumstances and the surroundings,' she told the Post. 'I thought I'd only be there for an hour or two.' She was then taken to a psychiatrist's office, where she spent 15 minutes explaining that she was sick, had not been sleeping well, was struggling in her classes and feared she might lose her scholarship. Taylor was then told that she would  have to stay overnight and was sent to an 'observation room' with four other patients. The psychiatrist's notes said that Taylor was in for 'involuntary treatment,' for 'insomnia, pressured speech, disorganized, declining grades'. The patients in the room were separated by low walls while staff watched over them, Taylor said. She still didn't receive medication or treatment. She wanted to call her mom, but her cellphone had died and she said the hospital wouldn't recharge it. Taylor was sent to St Joseph's Hospital (pictured) where she was put into 'involuntary treatment' and observed for six days after she had only gone to the health center for medication for her flu-like symptoms . Taylor is now suing Syracuse University, a university employee and St Joseph's Hospital for misdiagnosing and improperly treating her. Her hospital horror started at her university's health center (pictured), where she went to get medication . 'They hadn't done anything for me or my cold. They didn't take my blood pressure or even my temperature,' she told the Post. A nurse told her that if she cooperated and took the medication they gave her, she would be out in a shorter time period. She said she was given Risperdal, which is used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and Klonopin, used to treat panic disorder. Taylor told the post that they had to line up and take their pills, 'just like in the movie Cuckoo's Nest'. She was finally able to reach her mom, who came to the hospital to get her out of the ward. Taylor is now suing Syracuse University, a university employee and St Joseph's Hospital for misdiagnosing and improperly treating her, negligent and harmful use of medication and failure to get informed consent, among other reasons, the lawsuit states, according to the Daily Orange. Marc Held, Taylor's lawyer who filed the lawsuit in Manhattan Supreme Court, said her treatment was 'unfathomable'. The lawsuit claims that the 'unlawful, negligent and otherwise improper confinement', caused Taylor to suffer 'personal indignities'. Taylor has since left Syracuse and transferred to Rutgers University. Rebecca Reed Kantrowitz, senior vice president and dean of student affairs, said in a statement to the Daily Orange that the university 'strongly support the medical professionals and staff in the center'. In November 2014 the university announced they were in the process of searching for a new psychiatric provider and since has hired additional staff. Syracuse's attorney Matthew Larkin, however, told the Post that the university 'denies that it acted inappropriately in any way'.

She managed to evade detection, and even give birth recently, by constantly moving around a set of Thai islands. On Thursday,  Goodwin's younger sister Faye Dees spoke out to the Daily Mail Online, saying she wasn't at all surprised by Miller's nonchalant behavior in Thailand based on how she reacted to her brother's death and interacted with the family at trial nearly a decade ago. Victim: Kelly Lynn Miller, right, was arrested in Thailand on Tuesday after  years on the run. She was supposed to report to prison for hitting and killing truck-driver Donald Goodwin, left, in 2004, but instead fled the country . Dees, 66, says Miller didn't even try to help her brother after fatally striking him with her car in 2004, according to a witness at the scene who spoke to her. ‘She didn’t seem too concerned about Donny’s life according to the first witness on the scene. She didn't even know she had hit him,' Dees said. When the witness asked Miller if she knew Goodwin, she 'didn't even know who he was talking about'. The witness 'ran up there immediately to see if he would render any help and [Miller] just got on the phone and started calling for help. She was just so uncaring.’ Unmoved: On Thursday, Goodwin's sister spoke out to the Daily Mail Online, and said she was surprised by Miller's nonchalant behavior at a press conference in Thailand on Wednesday (above). Faye Dees, 66, says Miller acted similarly during her homicide trial in 2006 and 2007 . Return: On Wednesday, Thai police held a conference announcing the arrest of Miller and her upcoming extradition back to the U.S. She reportedly gave birth to a baby boy two months ago, who will also be sent back to the U.S. Goodwin had apparently pulled over to the emergency lane to check the tires on his tractor-trailer when Miller drunkenly swerved and side-swept the hauler - instantly killing Goodwin, according to AL.com. When Dees was finally able to confront Miller at her sentencing hearing in 2007, she and the rest of the Goodwin family were met with 'attitude' from the convict. 'When we were allowed to get up and make a comment to the judge...there were times she had facial expressions like \"I can’t believe what you’re saying.\" She just had an impression like she just didn’t understand what the big deal was,' Dees recalled. Dees says she and the rest of the family first found out about Miller's arrest Wednesday afternoon, when a reporter contacted her elderly mother, 87. 'She was pretty upset about it. She lives alone and she’s wasn’t feeling particularly well and she got the news just out of the blue...She was really too upset to talk.,' Dees said. She says before his death, Goodwin purchased a 7-acre property across the street from his mother's house and had taken time off to care for her when she underwent a quadruple bi-pass surgery. Another life: Miller said the father of her child is an American national living in Thailand legally, who did not know she was a fugitive . 'He was counting down the days to when he could retire,' Dees said. 'He was going to retire at 62 and he was just trying to work on his little piece of land.' Goodwin left behind a son now in his 30s, also named Donald, and was divorced. Goodwin's younger brother Larry also spoke with the Daily Mail Online, and said his brother's passing was 'real tough' on the son. When asked what she would tell Miller, if she had the opportunity, Dees said: 'I would just let her know that the whole family is elated that she has finally been caught. We didn’t think she ever would be, but justice is going to prevail for her.' 'I hope she has additional time added onto the original sentence and I hope it’s as much as they can possibly give her. I don’t know what they can do. I hope she doesn’t get off any time for good behavior or anything like that. ‘[Goodwin's] life did matter to his family and to people that cared about him. It may not have mattered to her,' Dees said. Miller is set to be extradited back to the U.S. soon. She was arrested Tuesday on the remote island of Koh Lanta, according to the Thai publication Phutketwan, about a month after authorities received a tip. Tourist Police officials said the 36-year-old woman had been moving between Koh Lanta, Samui and Hang islands without a current visa. Paradise lost: Miller was on the remote island of Koh Lanta when she was arrested by tourist police in Thailand on Tuesday. Above, a view of the island . Investigators said Miller delivered her son two months ago in a small clinic on the island of Samui, and his birth was not registered. It's believed that the father is an American national living in Thailand legally. The baby will also be deported back to the U.S. Thai authorities believe Miller's relatives in the US had been wiring money to her to help her make ends meet. After the 2004 crash, Miller was arrested  on DUI charges but released the next day after posting $1,000 bond. In 2006, a Jefferson County jury indicted Miller on a charge of vehicular homicide. She was re-arrested but again freed from jail after posting $10,000 bond. Miller was expected to go on trial in January 2007 but pleaded guilty and was sentenced to five years in prison. Before Miller was set to report to prison, she took off and was officially declared a fugitive in 2010. Following her arrest in Thailand Tuesday, Miller allegedly admitted to police that she flew into Bangkok in January 2009 and then spent the next six years traveling on an expired visa."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Fugitive Kelly Lynn Miller, 36, was arrested in Thailand this week .\nShe was convicted of mowing down 57-year-old trucker Donald Goodwin in 2004 drunk-driving accident but never reported to prison .\nOn Thursday, Goodwin's sister Faye Dees, 66, spoke with the Daily Mail Online about her happiness that Miller has finally been captured .\nDees remarked that pictures of Miller in Thailand, looking unmoved by her arrest and imminent extradition, were not surprising ."}]}

Cameron Redus, a student at University of the Incarnate Wood, was killed by Corporal Christopher Carter outside his San Antonio, Texas, apartment on December 6, 2013. The officer's microphone captures the 23-year-old accusing Carter of trying to sexually assault him and calling him pathetic. His last words are: 'You are going to shoot me?' Carter told Redus to stop 29 times and asked him to put his hands behind his back 20 times. Scroll down for video . Cameron Redus (left) can be heard calling officer Christopher Carter (right) pathetic and accusing him of sexual assault before he was shot dead outside his San Antonio apartment on December 6, 2013 . He ignores repeated requests by Carter to stop and put his hands on the hood of the patrol car. Carter, who resigned from from the University of Incarnate Word police force after the shooting, has been cleared of criminal wrongdoing after a Bexar (BAYR) County grand jury decided not to indict him on Wednesday,KENS 5 reported. Redus had a blood alcohol level of .155 when he was pulled over. His family contend that his son did make some mistakes that night, but they did not warrant the severity of the response. An autopsy conducted in March last year revealed all of the five shots fired by Carter were at close range. In the build-up Carter is heard on the audio repeatedly telling Redus to 'stay right there'. The front-facing camera in Carter's car was not working at the time, so all you can see is the back seats of his patrol car. Moments later Carter is heard telling Redus to step back before firing six bullets (scene pictured) You can hear Redus telling the officer he is scared and during the pat down says: 'Are you going to rape me right now?' Carter then tells him to put his hands behind his back as he is under arrest. The struggle then heats up as the pair fight for control. At one point Redus accuses the officer of choking him. He then tells Carter: 'You are pathetic. Are you going to shoot me if I don't stop?' 'Is that what cops do? They shoot people.' All the while Carter keeps telling Redus to stop, but he refuses to listen. Redus then says: 'You piece of s***'. Carter then fires six shots at close range, killing Redus. The student's family have said he was never aggressive or confrontational but, according to Corporal Carter, Cameron tried to beat him with his own baton after he was pulled over for driving erratically. Redus' family contends that even though he made some mistakes that night, he did not deserve the aggressive response by Corporal Carter . His parents, Mickey and Valerie Redus, and their other sons, released a statement last year saying they were 'devastated' by the autopsy findings. 'We are stunned to learn that Cameron was . shot in the back from very close range. The report also shows that the . shot to his eye was delivered at a downward angle, again from very close . range,' they wrote. 'That knowledge, coupled with information from the earlier police . report indicating that Cameron died on his back with his legs underneath . him, has left us heartbroken and shaken to the core.' The family added that they did not . condone his decision to drive while under the influence, but said they . were 'thankful' he arrived home safely without harming anyone else on . the night in question. They added: 'Cameron’s mistakes do not negate the . amazing and productive life he lived nor the loving, encouraging and . compassionate person that he was. 'While mistakes do bear consequences, . the extreme and brutal results of Cameron’s encounter with Officer . Carter far exceed the magnitude of his mistakes.' The University of Incarnate Wood said they have fully supported the decision to release the audio tape of the confrontation. Following Carter's clearance by a grand jury, the school's management said in a release that they hope the recording will 'put to rest much of the misinformation disseminated by persons characterizing the recording.' They reveal that during the recording, you will hear Carter say: . 'Put your hands behind your back' – 20 times. 'Stop resisting' – 25 times . 'Stop' or 'Stop it' – 29 times . 'Stop or I will shoot you' – 5 times . 'You are under arrest'/'being arrested'/'resisting arrest' – 3 times. The last statements made by Cpl. Carter to Mr. Redus are: 'Stop, stop, stop, stop, get back, get back!'

The worrying incident occurred in the first half at White Hart Lane -- after Tottenham scored in the seventh minute -- but the 29-year-old left the pitch conscious following about five minutes of treatment. The Guardian added that he was wearing an oxygen mask. Play was temporarily stopped before resuming. As the match progressed, Swansea tweeted that Gomis was \"fine,\" with manager Garry Monk using the same word to describe Gomis' condition. Gomis spent the night in hospital as a precaution, Swansea said on its website. \"I wanted to reassure you concerning my health,\" Gomis told the website. \"It actually looks much scarier than it is physically dangerous, and I am feeling well now. \"I have been under a great deal of stress and fatigue due to my father's health, which requires me to go back and forth from France. \"I was disappointed that I couldn't help my team tonight, but now everything is back in order. I also want to thank everyone for their support and get well messages.\" Gomis had similar fainting spells in France, which prompted the president of his former club, Jean-Michel Aulas of Lyon, to tell French television in 2009: \"We can't not be worried, it scares you each time.\" Swansea ran tests on Gomis, said Monk, prior to signing him on a free transfer last July. \"He just has a little bit of low blood pressure which causes you a little bit of problems,\" Monk said in a televised interview on Sky. \"It's been part of his life. We were well aware of that when we signed him. He's done all the hospital checks and all the medical checks you can possibly do and it's just part of his life. \"It's no problems whatsoever.

The Prime Minister had promised to reduce net migration to the ‘tens of thousands’ by the General Election. However, last month that vow was shattered when figures showed it had hit a record high. David Cameron’s pledge to reduce net migration to the ‘tens of thousands’ is no longer taken seriously by the Office for Budget Responsibility . Home Secretary Theresa May later insisted the Tories would restate the failed target to slash net migration to fewer than 100,000 if they returned to Government. But yesterday the OBR heaped embarrassment on ministers by criticising the prediction. In a document published alongside the Budget, it said its previous forecasts had been ‘underpinned by the assumption’ that net migration – the measure of how many people have come into Britain minus those who have left – would be 105,000 by 2019. Theresa May said Tories would slash net migration to fewer than 100,000 if they stayed in power . It stated: ‘A reduction over time seems consistent with the international environment and with the Government’s declared efforts to reduce it.’ But in a blow to Mr Cameron, it added: ‘In light of recent evidence, it no longer seems central to assume it will decline so steeply.’ Instead, it said net migration would ‘tend towards 165,000 in the long term’. On taking power in 2010, Mr Cameron pledged to bring the politically-sensitive net migration figure below 100,000. But last month the figure hit 300,000 – fuelled in large part by net migration from outside the EU of 190,000. Downing Street described the figures as a ‘disappointment’ but also a reflection of a growing economy. The highest number previously recorded was 600,000 in September 2010. When Mr Cameron entered Downing Street in May 2010 net migration was running at 244,000. Shadow immigration minister David Hanson said: ‘David Cameron’s “no ifs, no buts” pledge on net migration is in complete tatters; not even the Office of Budget Responsibility believes the Prime Minister’s promise any more and are now planning for it to be broken. ‘If you needed any more evidence that this government simply can’t be trusted to deliver their promises on immigration, this is it.’"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "PM promised to reduce net migration to ‘tens of thousands’ by the election .\nBut vow was shattered when figures last month showed it hit record high .\nTheresa May then vowed to cut number to 100,000 if Tories stay in power .\nBut OBR said net migration would ‘tend towards 165,000 in the long term’"}]}

It turns out a lot more than most of the rest of us. Gross, 65, has started to make up for the five years he spent imprisoned in Cuba by traveling abroad, attending the State of the Union address as a guest of the Obamas and last week meeting Pope Francis at the Vatican to personally thank him for his role in helping to win Gross' freedom. After five years of being disconnected from the outside world, Gross now frequently posts on social media, writing of family reunions, eating the foods he longed for in prison and the reminders he experiences of his time in Cuba. \"I can't get away from Cuba,\" Gross wrote after hearing a Cuban song playing in an airport on his travels. While visiting Israel, he posted a photo of Cohiba cigars advertised for sale in a Tel Aviv tobacco shop. In 2009, Gross was arrested by Cuban state security agents and eventually sentenced to 15 years in prison for importing banned communications equipment to the island. Gross said he was merely helping the island's small Jewish community get online, but Cuban officials accused of him being part of a U.S. government plot to destabilize the island's single-party Communist government. Cuba has highly restricted Internet access, and most people are not able to access the Web in their homes or on their phones. On December 17, 2014, Gross was freed, along with three Cuban intelligence agents and a Cuban man convicted of spying for the United States. It was part of a deal between the Cuban and U.S. governments to reestablish diplomatic relations after five decades of Cold War animosity. Gross, his wife, Judy, his attorney and three U.S. congressmen flew from Havana to his home state of Maryland aboard a U.S. military jet, one of the smaller versions of Air Force One used to transport President Barack Obama. The image of Gross celebrating his freedom aboard the flight home with CNN reporting the news of his release on a TV screen in the background became the picture he would use on his @AlanPGross Twitter page. The night of his release, he enjoyed a meal of spicy Thai food with family and friends, a far cry from the bland rations he was forced to eat in prison. In January, Gross changed the status of his Facebook page to read that he had left his job as \"hostage\" at the Carlos Finlay military hospital where had been held in Havana. Later, he shared pictures of a visit to the dentist's office to replace the teeth that he lost while he was held in Cuba. With his dental concerns met, he moved on to food. Gross also recounted savoring long-denied bowls of chili and bagels loaded with lox and cream cheese. Many of the posts are the daily jottings of a man returning to his life after an extended absence: Gross renewing an expired driver's license or visiting a Starbucks for the first time in five years. But in other posts, he writes about taking in a sunset on the beach in Israel, seeing the snow fall in Washington and believing citizens in every country should have unimpeded access to the Internet. A spokeswoman for Gross turned down a CNN request for an interview with him but confirmed that the social media accounts are his. Rep. Chris Van Hollen, the Democrat representing the Maryland district Gross hails from, called it \"incredibly moving\" that a man who spent five years in a Cuban prison has since sat next to first lady Michelle Obama and met the pope. More than that, he's come to signify the changing dynamics between officials in Washington and Havana. \"Alan did not ask for this special role in history,\" Van Hollen said, \"but he's become a catalyst for this new chapter in American and Cuban relations.\" The photos that Gross posted online show a smiling man, slowly putting back on some of the 100 pounds he lost in prison, no longer the gaunt-faced, hollow-eyed prisoner who had gone on hunger strikes to protest his conditions while he was held in Cuba. \"The distance we've come since December 17th 2014 has been a rewarding journey,\" Gross wrote in a Facebook post Saturday. \"For which we're grateful.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rep.

Or so Floyd Mayweather and Bob Arum told us as they walked onto a famous stage here as collaborators in the big sell of the richest fight of all time. Money talks. Louder than the maestro of the ring who calls himself by that bizarre nickname. Floyd Mayweather speaks as Manny Pacquiao's promoter Bob Arum looks on in Los Angeles on Wednesday . Mayweather and Arum insist there is no lasting animosity after they went their separate ways in business . Mayweather (left) and Pacquiao meet in a long-awaited mega-fight on May 2 at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas . More noisily than the promoter who has banged the drum for many of the biggest fights ever, from Ali-Frazier 1 all the way to Mayweather-Pacquiao this May 2 in Las Vegas . ‘Animosity?’ said Arum of his relationship with Mayweather who, in his prime, walked out on him. ‘Nah.’ ‘Never a problem between us,’ said Mayweather. But wasn’t it Mayweather who always blamed Arum, subsequently Pacquiao’s promoter, whenever the moguls failed to make this match for which Planet Earth has been clamouring for five years. ‘No,’ said the No 1 pound-for-pound boxer in the world. ‘The only reason we broke up was because it was time for me to become my own promoter. ‘Me and my father (also his trainer) and my uncles (also his corner men when called upon) to become the Boxing Mayweathers. ‘I needed to get that experience for when it came to giving back to the sport by helping the youngsters.’ Mayweather, here with Justin Bieber, said there was '‘Never a problem between us' in relation to Arum . 'Animosity? Nah,' said Arum of Mayweather. He (left) is now the promoter for Pacquiao . ‘Blame me,’ said Arum. ‘It was a generational thing. Floyd wanted me to reach out to the African-American audience. But that was a different cultural group from when we put on Ali and Frazier and Foreman. ‘Floyd saw the potential in the hip-hop community but I could not connect with them. So, yes, it was time for him to go off on his own.’ Money - not the man but the $350 million to half a billion dollars this fight is expected to generate – is a powerful healing agent. These old rivals thanked each other – as well as everyone else they could think of – for bringing home this mother lode. The last vestiges of a dark age in which boxers were exploited and then left to rot with the after-effects of being battered about the head have been condemned to history by this deal. One which has coerced rival cable TV giants Showtime and HBO into sharing their part of the spoils. One which is not so much a commercial world record breaker as out of this world. ‘All of boxing will be elevated by this fight,’ says Arum. All is forgiven. Arum (left) said his split from Mayweather was a 'generational thing' and that there's no hard feelings . Remember Mayweather demanding Olympic standard random drugs testing, a stipulation which cast aspersions as to how Pacquiao had managed to keep rising through the weights to win world titles in an unprecedented – and probably unsurpassable – eight divisions? And then Pacquiao suggesting a $5 million penalty if either of them failed such a test? That bet was turned down by Mayweather but Arum explains: ‘It wasn’t because Floyd was any more scared about the result than Manny. It was just that he and his team figured they would get a lot more if Manny didn’t pass the test. Just as we knew we would get a damn sight more than $5million if Floyd failed the test.’ They still differ on some of the fine points when it comes to claiming credit for making this mega-bucks spectacular finally happen. Mayweather says: ‘The chance meeting between me and Manny at the basketball game and then our talk in his hotel room got all this together. ‘After that I rang Al Haymon (the new Svengali for top boxers) every week. The first time he said \"Not Yet\". The second and third time, \"Not Yet.\" Then he said \"Almost\" and we got it done.’ Mayweather arrives in the arena ahead of the glitzy press conference in Los Angeles on Wednesday night . Pacquiao, a resounding underdog for the fight, gets his own rousing reception on entry for the appearance . Arum talks of how his meeting with CBS television chief Les Moonves broke the deadlock: ‘He told me he could bring Floyd to the table and I believed him. So when he asked if I would meet with Al Haymon I said of course and we worked out the major issues in a couple of hours. ‘Then we got together with HBO and Showtime and it took only minutes for them to agree to share the broadcast. There will still some small details to be resolved but although they maybe took longer than they should have we got it done.’ The fans couldn’t care less who got it done. The world waits with bated breath for the two best boxers on the planet to move on from this face-to-face in Los Angeles to opposite corners of the ring in the MGM Grand Garden Arena. ‘The best against the best,’ says Mayweather. ‘That’s what makes it so exciting.’ It has always been thus. Only sometimes it takes money to make even the best see sense. Like a minimum $180 million for Mayweaher, $120 million for Pacquiao. A fortune so vast that it is more than Ali, Frazier and Foreman ever dreamed of."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Floyd Mayweather and Bob Arum, now Manny Pacquiao's promoter, both said they have no problem with each other despite famously falling out .\nBoth said they split at the right time ahead of Mayweather-Pacquiao fight .\nThe mega-fight is due to rake in from $350 million to half a billion dollars .\nArum said on Wednesday: ‘All of boxing will be elevated by this fight’\nBoth dispute who was most influential in bringing the fight to fruition .\nThe world's two best fighters meet on May 2 at MGM Grand Garden Arena ."}]}

And the inconvenience of return processes, which are often costly, have resulted in over $460 million in unwanted purchases over the years. In response to these alarming figures, PayPal Australia has launched a new service for customers to refund up to $45 of return shipping costs for their online purchases. Daily Mail Australia has gathered a series of images of incorrect packages, which have been posted on social media by disappointed customers. Recent research has found that more than five million Australians have experienced an online shopping fail.

Difficult and costly returns processes have resulted in over $460 million in unwanted purchases. Another customer was delivered an excessive supply of butter . This shopper was disappointed to see her liquid foundation had leaked all over the packaging when it was delivered to her . PayPal Australia announced the launch of their free shipping return service on Thursday, allowing customers to request a refund on shipping costs of up to $45 on the PayPal website within 14 days. Joint research by Ipsos and PayPal, conducted in the past 12 months on 1001 respondents, found that more than half of those who had considered returning an unwanted item had failed to do so mainly due to shipping costs. Other factors also included unnecessary hassle  or complicated returns processes. The research on Australians aged 18-64 also revealed that nine in 10 respondents said that they would more likely shop online if the retailer had a free returns policy.

The black dress, a copy of one worn by Thor actress Jaime Alexander at the film's premiere in 2013, features top-to-bottom see-through panels on the front and back. However the unsatisfied shopper posted comparison pictures on the seller's page, showing how the dress revealed far more than she intended.

Humayun Akhtar, 66, built the sprawling Florham Park home for him and his wife in 2007. Almost immediately, he says, cracks began to appear throughout the house, which he soon learned was collapsing into its unsound foundations and sliding off the side of the hill on which it was built. Now Akhtar is in a protracted court battle with builder JDN Properties, who he says have left him financially ruined and emotionally broken. This home in Florham Park, New Jersey was meant to be Humayun Akhtar's $1.6 million dream home for him and his wife but substandard construction turned it into a nightmare . 'I used to be a singing, laughing person,' Akhtar told WABC. 'I don't listen to music anymore. I haven't seen a movie in ten years, I can't relax anymore.' Akhtar and his family have not spent a single night in the home, which has buckled so severely that a marble placed on the floor will roll freely without the slightest push. 'I spent all the money I had and I was cleaned out. I have nothing now,' he said. Akhtar successfully won a settlement against JDN Properties in 2011 for $7.4 million on claims the company defrauded him by cutting corners on soil beneath the foundation that wasn't strong enough to bear the house. However, the company recently won an appeal of that decision. JDN Properties argues they tried to get Akhtar to let them repair the home before the damages worsened.

Akhtar maintains he was too afraid the company would do a quick fix on the foundation. Now the case will be seen before a New Jersey jury, which will decide if JDN Properties knowingly defrauded Akhtar. Meanwhile, Akhtar's attorney David Stanziale told ABC News that the home has gone into foreclosure. 'This whole thing has destroyed my life,' Akhtar said. 'I feel like a fool. Now I have to live 250 years to recover all the money I lost.'

Hundreds had already planned to rally against Vladimir Putin's today, but this protest was abandoned to instead demonstrate against Mr Nemtsov's death in an apparent 'contract hit' in the shadow of the Kremlin. Russian riot police, armed with batons, were observing the protest which remained peaceful. The mood was sombre, with heavy security as police helicopters flew overhead and police boats patrolled the river. Families, the old and young walked slowly, with many carrying portraits of Mr Nemtsov, who was shot dead while walking home from a restaurant in central Moscow on Friday night. 'If we can stop the campaign of hate that's being directed at the opposition, then we have a chance to change Russia. If not then we face the prospect of mass civil conflict,' Gennady Gudkov, an opposition leader, said before the march. 'The authorities are corrupt and don't allow any threats to them to emerge. Boris was uncomfortable for them.' The march follows last night's demonstration on the bridge where Mr Nemtsov was shot, with scores of mourners gathering to lay flowers.

CCTV footage showed the Russian opposition leader walking along the Great Moskvoretsky Bridge in Moscow, before a person is seen approaching him from the shadows. The gunman then makes a quick escape in a car nearby. In the days before his death, Mr Nemtsov, a former deputy prime minister, said he feared being killed by the Russian leader. 'I'm afraid Putin will kill me. I believe that he was the one who unleashed the war in the Ukraine. I couldn't dislike him more,' he said in an interview with Russia's Sobesednik news website. He also revealed his 86-year-old mother's fears that he was be assassinated because of his outspoken views. '\"When will you stop cursing Putin? He'll kill you for that.\" She was completely serious,' he added. Opposition activists also blamed the Russian President for his death, claiming they were in 'no doubt' it was politically motivated.

The father-of-four was shot four times by assailants previously reported as having been in a white car as he walked across a bridge over the Moskva River . Marina Litvinenko described news of the veteran liberal politician's shooting as 'absolutely devastating'. She was asked on BBC Radio 4's Broadcasting House programme whether she believed the shooting of Mr Nemtsov near the Kremlin in Moscow was linked to her husband's poisoning. She replied: 'It's a different way to kill a person, but a way to present that anybody who will try to say something against us will be killed.' Ilya Yashin, a friend and fellow opposition leader, said he hoped the killing would not frighten people. 'Essentially it is an act of terror. It is a political murder aimed at frightening the population, or the part of the population that supported Nemtsov and did not agree with the government. I hope we won't get scared, that we will continue what Boris was doing. 'It was President Putin who created this atmosphere of hate in our country, the atmosphere of intolerance, which one way or another materialized in the bullet that killed my friend Boris Nemtsov.' Meanwhile the Kremlin, which uncharacteristically allowed the protest to go ahead, is investigating whether the killing is linked to the conflict in Ukraine. National investigators who answer to the Russian leader say they are pursuing several lines of inquiry, including the possibility that Mr Nemtsov, a Jew, was killed by radical Islamists or that the opposition killed him to blacken Putin's name. Putin's opponents say such suggestions show the cynicism of Russia's leaders as they whip up nationalism, hatred and anti-Western hysteria to rally support for his policies on Ukraine and deflect blame for an economic crisis. 'It is a blow to Russia. If political views are punished this way, then this country simply has no future,' Sergei Mitrokhin, an opposition leader, said of Mr Nemtsov's murder. Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov was shot dead in Moscow at the age of 55. His 87-year-old mother Dina had a premonition that her son would be killed, according to the politician. He told earlier this month how his mother warned him: 'When will you stop cursing Putin? He'll kill you for that.' Nemtsov studied physics at State University of Gorky and earned a PhD in Physics and Mathematics. In the wake of the Chernobyl disaster, Nemtsov organised a protest movement in his hometown, which prevented the construction of a new nuclear power plant in the region. The liberal reformer rose to prominence under Boris Yeltsin and became a fierce critic of Vladimir Putin. Nemtsov first gained an international profile after being spotted by former British premier Margaret Thatcher as a future leader of Russia. She praised his market reforms after visiting Nizhny Novgorod where as governor in the early 1990s he led spearheaded reforms. The father-of-four, 55, was Deputy Prime Minister of Russia from 1997 to 1998 during Boris Yeltsin's presidency. He was sentenced to 15 days in jail in January 2011 after being arrested at a New Year's Eve protest rally for 'disobedience towards police'. The politician founded a number of opposition movements after leaving the Russian parliament in 2003 and he had served as the co-chair of the opposition Republican Party of Russia - People's Freedom Party since 2012. He was a prominent and vocal critic of Mr Putin and wrote a number of reports in recent years linking Putin and his inner circle to corruption. It has been reported that Nemtsov angered Putin's government two years ago when he charged that billions of dollars had been stolen from funds designated for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, his hometown. He has written more than 60 academic publications about quantum physics, thermodynamics and acoustics and  designed n of antennas for space apparatuses. Jewish advocacy website AJC named Nemtsov as one of the most prominent Jews in Russia thanks to his mother's heritage. In his 1997 memoir, The Provincial Man, Nemtsov revealed that he was baptised Russian Orthodox in secret. He leaves behind his wife Raisa Akhmetovna and four children."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "More than 20,000 march through Moscow to protest against the killing of Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov .\nVast crowds of mourners and activists waved flags and held placards which read: 'I am not afraid'\nProtest comes two days after Mr Nemtsov was shot dead in 'contract hit' as he walked along bridge near the Kremlin .\nCCTV footage shows person approaching Mr Nemtsov, shooting him and escaping in a nearby getaway car .\nWidow of murdered Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko says she had 'no doubt' killing was politically motivated .\nMeanwhile dozens gather outside the Russian Embassy in London to protests against Putin government ."}]}

Rowing in unison, two girls paddle a canoe to school. Life on Lake Nicaragua is peaceful, rustic and isolated, but this could change with the pending completion of a canal that builders are likening to Panama's famed waterway. Headed by Hong Kong-based consortium HK Nicaragua Canal Development Investment Company (HKND), the $50 billion Nicaragua Canal (also called the Nicaragua Grand Canal and Interoceanic Canal) would create a gargantuan new shipping route through Nicaragua by connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. HKND was granted a 50-year concession by the Nicaraguan government in 2013 to build and operate the 278-kilometer (172 miles) canal, reportedly with the option for an extension. Construction will run from the Rio Punta Gorda on the Caribbean Coast to Brito on the Pacific. At up to 1,700 feet wide and 90 feet deep, the canal, if completed, will be deeper and wider than the Panama Canal. HKND announced the start of construction of the canal with a ceremony on December 22, 2014. The canal will run through Lake Nicaragua (among other areas), Central America's largest lake and freshwater reservoir, which not only preserves an integral part of Nicaragua's ecosystem, but directly supports numerous communities. By some estimates, 30,000 people will have to be relocated to carve a path for the canal. The prospect is nothing short of alarming for those living in the area, and those who cherish its untouched splendor. With the pending completion of the canal in 2019, Lake Nicaragua may be impacted in ways only time will reveal. Environmental experts worry that the shallow waters of the lake won't be able to withstand the dredging that will come with construction. Additionally, communities will likely be displaced and wetlands may become more vulnerable to destruction. \"In terms of the canal impact on Lake Nicaragua, one big concern is the damage to the quality of the water; the ship traffic will pollute the water with toxic sediments and industrial chemicals and introduce destructive invasive species, plants and animals,\" Dr. Jorge A. Huete-Perez, vice president of the Nicaraguan Academy of Sciences and director of the Molecular Biology Center at the University of Central America told CNN. \"Dredging of the lake for the construction of the canal will render the lake a 'dead zone' because of hypoxia, eutrophication and turbidity.\" In January, London-based scidev.net reported that an independent commission of experts -- including scientists from the InterAmerican Network of Academies of Science, Nicaraguan Academy of Sciences and International Council for Science -- had reached similar conclusions, warning of \"unintended adverse consequences that could do economic, environmental and social harm.\" Like other critics of the canal construction, Huete-Perez wants greater transparency from HKND and the Nicaraguan government. \"This whole thing has been fast-tracked without public consultations or the opportunity for an informed, documented debate,\" said Huete-Perez. On January 9, 2015, HKND responded to concerns about the lake's impact on communities in a statement on its website. \"From July 21 to July 30, 2014, we and our environmental and social impact advisor, Environmental Resources Management (ERM), held scoping meetings across Nicaragua.  Approximately 5,000 people participated in the scoping meetings, including housewives, students, professionals, agricultural producers, fishermen, artisans, businessmen and scholars,\" reads the company's statement, in part. The company says it held a press conference broadcast in real time to the public to announce the route of the canal and comment on the technical, geological, cultural and environmental impact of the project. Some skeptics doubt the hyper-ambitious canal is realistic. Pedro Alvarez, chairman of civil engineering at Rice University, has expressed doubts that it will ever be completed. He worries that it will be abandoned. His greatest concern is severe damage to Lake Nicaragua. Despite the concerns of environmental experts, the project is underway, making a visit to this beautiful area more compelling than ever. Largely unmarred by development, Lake Nicaragua is a sight to behold. During my recent guided visit with Nicaragua Vacations, I took a boat tour through the Islets of Granada, home to 365 scattered islands with majestic views of Mombacho volcano. At times, there was no other boat in sight -- only the rustle of a hidden howler monkey in the bushes and the volcano, ensconced in clouds and morning fog. The feeling of being everywhere and nowhere at once is part of Lake Nicaragua's charm. Another part of its charm is the people who live on it. At Padre Nello School on Lake Nicaragua, about 90 children canoe to school each day. Jicaro Island EcoLodge works with Padre Nello to bring clean water to the children and educational projects that encourage sustainability on the lake. Guests of the lodge can arrange visits. The islets are just southeast of the city of Granada (population approximately 120,000), where colonial buildings defy time, narrow alleyways lead to garden courtyards, charming boutiques are full of local art and street carts overflow with everything from iguanas to cashews. While Granada pulses with Old World charm, Lake Nicaragua stands still with nature as its compass, mostly untouched by modernity. For now. Nicaragua Vacations; +1 866 347 4012 .

And Manuel Pellegrini's men – who sent on £50million substitutes Wilfried Bony and Stevan Jovetic to try and salvage the game – were lucky to survive with 11 men after bad challenges from Sergio Aguero and Martin Demichelis. CLICK HERE to read Sportsmail's Joe Bernstein's full match report from Turf Moor. Host commentator . What a potential season-defining moment Burnley's win could be tonight. The victory still sees the Clarets in the relegation zone - but by only one point with Sunderland looking over their shoulders ever-more. Meanwhile the defeat for City is damaging for their title hopes. A win for Chelsea on Sunday would see Manuel Pellegrini's side trail by eight points with nine games remaining. City now have to pick themselves up with a daunting trip to Barcelona in the Champions League on Wednesday night. Until next time, have a good evening! And the referee brings a close to the match. Relegation candidates Burnley have stunned the champions Manchester City! George Boyd's goal separates the two sides. Cue pandemonium among the Turf Moor faithful. 92 mins: Burnley make their second defensive change of the match as Danny Ings is taken off for Steven Reid. The hosts are now playing without any recognised strikers. 91 mins: Oh wow, what a huge moment in the match. Pablo Zabaleta charges into the Burnley box and falls under the challenge of Mee. On first inspection it looked a penalty and the replays suggest so too. However the referee decides otherwise and awards a free-kick to Burnley as Jason Shackell is fouled by Zabaleta during his tumble. The City players are incensed. Will that moment spell curtains for their title challenge? There will be four minutes of injury time to be added on... 86 mins: Burnley make their first change of the match and it's a defensive one as striker Sam Vokes is replaced by Stephen Ward. Lampard's appearance is his 600th in the Premier League. Only Ryan Giggs has made more. 82 mins: And that cross is Toure's last piece of action as he is replaced by Frank Lampard. 81 mins: What a chance that was for City to equalise. Navas cuts the ball back on the right flank to Yaya Toure. The latter whips in a devilish cross that finds the head of Aguero at the back post. The Argentina international can only head over from just outside the six-yard box though. The frustration grows for the visitors. City are continuing to press for an equaliser but have yet to breach the Burnley defence. As they push further forward gaps are starting to appear which Burnley are beginning to exploit. The visitors have simply not been at it tonight, a huge credit must go to the Clarets though. They've been brilliant. 74 mins: Pellegrini makes his second change of the match as Silva is replaced by Stevan Jovetic. 71 mins: Two of Burnley's back four are now cautioned as Michael Duff sees yellow for a foul. 66 mins: City have just over 20 minutes plus added time to turnaround this scoreline. Victory for City would see them close the gap on Chelsea to two-points ahead of their match against Southampton on Sunday. A defeat means the Blues could go eight points clear if they beat the Saints. Do the City players want it enough? 63 mins: City react to conceding the opener by taking off the ineffectual Dzeko and replacing him with Wilfried Bony. Demichelis' act of cynicism has been punished spectacularly by Burnley. From the resulting free-kick Trippier's set piece is headed away by City captain Vincent Kompany. Unfortunately for the defender his clearance falls straight to Boyd who hits a sweet left-footed volley first time that arrows into the bottom corner. A fantastic strike. 60 mins: Martin Demichelis swiftly follows Mee into the referees book for a cynical challenge on Ings. 58 mins: We have our first booking of the match and it's a harsh one as Ben Mee is cautioned for a challenge on Jesus Navas. Replays show it was a soft decision in comparison to some of the unpunished tackles that the City players have dealt. 55 mins: What a hit by George Boyd - he's so unlucky. The Scotland international hits a hook volley, with his weaker right foot, over his shoulder that narrowly goes past the post. That's got the crowd engaged. 51 mins: David Silva has just produced a collectors item - a bad touch. And at precisely the wrong time too. Aguero does brilliantly to spin around a Burnley defender on the halfway line and race clear. With Silva in support he plays in the playmaker but his first touch forces him wide with Heaton bearing down on him. That could, and probably should have been, 1-0 to the visitors. Will the deadlock be broken in this stalemate? A Manchester City fan has just proposed to his Burnley-supporting girlfriend on the pitch at half time. Thankfully she said yes because it’s a long walk back to the touchline. That’s the best entertainment we’ve had here so far. Disappointing first half from the champions. Surely they haven’t got one eye on Barcelona when there’s still something to play for in the title race. City showed a few flashes towards the end of the first half but Tom Heaton has only had two saves to make, and fairly routine saves at that. And the referee has drawn a close to first half proceedings at Turf Moor. In truth it's been a rather drab affair with no clear-cut chances yet created for either side. The hosts will be pleased with their display so far as they aim to avoid relegation, but City know they have to improve if they are to keep their hopes alive of retaining the Premier League title. 42 mins: City are dominating possession now and the stats support that with 70 per cent of the ball in their favour. However, the key statistic is that it is still 0-0. Can they make their dominance count? 34 mins: The visitors are slowly starting to come into the game more. Again Dzeko wriggles free inside in the Burnley box but is tackled before he can shoot. The ball falls into the path of Aguero who chooses to shoot rather the cross. The end product? An effort well wide of goal. Nevertheless a warning sign for the hosts. 29 mins: It's taken nearly half an hour but finally a keeper is forced into a save. Heaton comes off his line well to deny Dzeko from squeezing in a near post effort. From the resulting build-up the goalkeeper holds the ball well from an Aguero strike.  As the old saying goes, you wait ages for a bus and then two come along at once. 26 mins: And that trend continues as Edin Dzeko drags an ambitious left-footed shot well wide of Tom Heaton's goal. 23 mins: The fans have little to cheer about so far and it's hardly surprising. We're approaching the midway point of the first half and neither side has managed a shot on target yet. 15 mins: Still no clear-cut chances created by either side. Both goalkeepers have had yet to break sweat. 10 mins: Burnley right back Kieran Trippier crosses a ball that hits Gael Clichy. The home fans roar for a penalty but replays clearly show the ball hits the left back in the chest. 6 mins: As you would expect Burnley came out of the traps strongly in the opening exchanges. City have weathered that 'mini-storm' and are starting to express themselves. The match has started in Lancashire. Can Burnley stun City? Kick-off is imminent... Look away Burnley fans... City are unbeaten in their last six visits to Turf Moor in all competitions, winning the last five in a row and scoring 17 times in the last four. To make matters the visitors are unbeaten in their last 13 matches in all competitions against the Clarets (W8 D5 L0). Records are there to be broken though... In a close battle for the Premier League title, December 28 2014 could be a date that haunts City. Leading 2-0 at half-time against Burnley, Manuel Pellegrini's side squander a two-goal lead to draw with Sean Dyche's men. George Boyd scored straight after the break, turning home Danny Ings' shot while in an offside position. Then Ashley Barnes reacted quickest in a crowded penalty area to smash home a loose ball to earn the visitors a draw. Pellegrini knows his side can't afford a repeat performance like that if they are to close the gap on league leaders Chelsea. Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany returns to the starting line-up after being an unused substitute against Leicester on 4 March. Quartet Pablo Zabaleta, Gael Clichy, Fernandinho and Edin Dzeko also start as Manuel Pellegrini rings the changes. Right so the Burnley team news is and Mike Duff and Sam Vokes come in for Michael Keane and Michael Kightly in the only two changes for the Clarets from the side that lost 2-0 at Anfield against Liverpool. Manchester City XI: Hart, Zabaleta, Kompany, Demichelis, Clichy, Navas, Fernandinho, Yaya Toure, Silva, Dzeko, Aguero . Subs: Caballero, Mangala, Sagna, Nasri, Lampard, Bony, Jovetic . Burnley XI: Heaton, Trippier, Shackell, Duff, Mee; Barnes, Arfield, Jones, Boyd; Ings, Vokes . Subs: Gilks, Keane, Reid, Ward, Jutkiewicz, Wallace, Kightly.

When international illusionist Keith Barry introduces an extraordinary new Generation Game-type TV show tonight, viewers will see what happens when the contestants who are competing to win pots of money are given bizarre instructions under hypnosis. They end up doing the most mind-bogglingly embarrassing things – to the extent that while your toes do curl for them, you have to remind yourself that they have willingly volunteered to make fools of themselves. Hypnotist Keith Barry with five contestants on ITV's new show You're Back In The Room . Hosted by Phillip Schofield, ITV's You're Back In The Room pits five hypnotised strangers against each other as they take on apparently simple game-show challenges straight out of Bruce Forsyth's 70s heyday, such as making balloon animals and doing impersonations of pop stars. The twist that brings it into the 21st century Hunger Games-style arena is when Keith – who's already hypnotised them – then sabotages their chances of winning by telling them to do the weirdest things. So for example, when a clutch of five contestants is asked to make sculptures out of clay, one is made to believe that the clay is a miracle face cream, while another is certain it smells of dog dirt. A third is convinced she really is a mad French sculptor, a fourth that everyone else's sculptures are obscene and the final one, when triggered by hearing that famous Unchained Melody song, believes he's Patrick Swayze in the amorous pottery scene from the film Ghost. Of course the question of how safe it is to play with the volunteering contestants' minds like this, and just how humiliating the results are once all inhibitions are removed, is going to make this one of the most controversial shows ever. Keith, an Irish hypnotist and magician who has appeared on stage and TV all over the world and also uses his technique to help people overcome phobias and shyness, admits even he wasn't quite sure what would happen. Kate Cook, with host Phillip Schofield, believes her sculpting clay is face cream after being hypnotised . 'They were like greyhounds coming out onto the track, ready to accept any suggestion I gave them,' he says. 'But I was a bit worried they might run amok because while Phillip is on stage at all times, I'm not. So even though the contestants couldn't see me I still felt I had a duty of responsibility to keep control over their behaviour. 'Hypnosis is about shutting down the conscious mind and re-igniting the unconscious and the imagination, so while I give instructions to them under hypnosis the contestants might interpret those instructions in all kinds of ways. For example, 60-year-old contestant Carolyn was a polite and gentle soul off-camera, but after hypnosis I could get her to do anything. When she was told to be a frustrated French sculptor, she got very, very angry. Phillip was shocked! 'Another contestant was asked to throw a pizza off stage. Her imagination went wild and she threw it over a member of the audience who happened to be beautifully dressed for her birthday celebrations. That proves just how spontaneous the show is.' Every week members of the studio audience who've come to see the show being filmed are invited to take part in a few tests before the show begins to see which of them are more susceptible to hypnosis – and so who is likely to make a fool of themselves and get the biggest laughs. Then five are picked to compete in the challenges onstage. 'Anyone can be put into a trance but everyone has different levels of susceptibility,' explains Keith. 'One studio audience test I did where I got people to imagine their hands are glued together was classic. Many of them, even the cynical ones, found they couldn't pull their hands apart. 'Once we've picked our five candidates I take them backstage and put them into a deep trance, which takes about 20 minutes. First I make sure they shut down their physical bodies by getting them to sit comfortably, focus on their breathing and relax. Then I get them to imagine they're at the top of the stairs and to count down, imagining their own choice of colour for the stairs and how many there are as they're walking down, so that by the time they reach the bottom they've drifted into a calm hypnotic state. From there I'm able to implant suggestions into their minds.' Keith then brings the contestants round before they emerge onto the stage. But they're still in a waking trance, and although they're speaking and acting normally in this state, Keith only has to say the word 'sleep' and they instantly nod off. At this point he can implant instructions into their minds which will get them to behave totally out of character – and hinder their progress during each round of games. 'Once you've hypnotised someone once, you can pretty much put them under instantly any time you meet them afterwards,' says Keith. TV chef Paul Rankin is served dinnerby a hypnotised contestant on the show . The instructions he gives them can have astonishing effects. One episode involves the contestants serving a champagne dinner to four popular TV chefs – Ed Baines, Aldo Zilli, Paul Rankin and Lesley Waters – in a supposedly 'posh' restaurant. But once Keith suggests ideas into their minds, it quickly turns into more of a dog's dinner. One woman is told she's lost her expensive ring in the mashed potato, while another participant is convinced the guests are toddlers who need encouragement to eat their food and the girl serving the gravy thinks she's aboard a ship in rough seas. Because detailed portrayal of the way Keith manages to put the contestants into a state of deep trance is banned under stage hypnosis laws, it naturally begs the question of whether the participants are acting, or at least playing to the gallery. Keith insists it's all bona fide. 'Phillip was sceptical at the outset but he soon realised how real hypnosis is and how it allows people to do things they wouldn't normally do. After each show he tells the studio audience that he would never have become involved unless he was 100 per cent convinced that everything I do is real. But putting someone into a deep trance can't be shown on TV for legal reasons in case someone does it at home and they don't have me there to wake them up afterwards.' David Behan, a Harley Street hypnotherapist who treats a range of issues from weight loss to giving up smoking, says, 'People have been using hypnosis to cure themselves and others since ancient Egyptian times. Paul McKenna brought the positive aspects of hypnosis to the forefront with his TV shows in the 1990s. He showed people how they could utilise hypnosis to help themselves become more confident and conquer anxiety, bed-wetting, losing weight and giving up smoking. But the onus is on the therapist to use this technique in accordance with a moral code. Does this show do that? That's not for me to say, it will be up to the viewer to decide. Lots of people have never seen hypnosis being carried out and may want to investigate more. I know of Keith Barry but have never met him, but he's morally bound to make sure no harm comes to anyone taking part. 'Hypnosis should be used to help people and not used to encourage others to laugh at them. No one can be forced in their behaviour, under hypnosis they are simply following a suggestion. It's a heightened state of awareness. Perception at its most open.' Whether the show will put off people who might have considered hypnotherapy to help themselves we can never know. Keith says at the end of each show his final task is to 'de-fry', as he calls it, the five contestants and bring them back to normal consciousness. 'I remove all the game show suggestions I've implanted in their minds and replace them with confident thoughts so they can look to their futures in a positive way,' he insists. Then he shows them the footage of what they got up to – and if you want proof of the authenticity of what goes on, married mother Kate Cook offers it. 'I'm a bubbly person but there's no way I would normally have been able to do what I did under hypnosis,' says Kate, 30. 'I was told to fall in love with Phillip Schofield. I believed I was utterly in love with him and I believed he loved me too. I was waiting for him to propose to me any moment. It was surreal. Meanwhile my husband Chris was in the audience and a man next to him, said, 'Good grief, can you imagine what her boyfriend will say?' Chris said, 'That's my wife!' We know we live in an age when people crave to be famous – or even infamous. Kate, like all the other contestants I spoke to afterwards, said how much she enjoyed the whole experience. Ross Calder, a 33-year-old musician who'd been told he was naked on stage, told me, 'I truly believed I was naked even though I could see I was actually wearing clothes. But after the show I felt energised – as if I could accomplish anything.' Those who believe in self-control will watch with their hands over their eyes but Phillip Schofield, who is no doubt hoping it will get similar sort of ratings to BGT, is convinced it will be a hit. 'It's absolutely hysterical. I had no idea what to expect, but the contestants completely lose their inhibitions under hypnosis. I think one of the highlights was Kate professing her love for me – you really have to see it to believe it.'

Championship leaders Hearts could clinch automatic promotion to the top tier if results go their way this weekend. That would leave Rangers embroiled in a grim battle for the second promotion spot under new manager Stuart McCall, although on current form they could even miss the play-offs. Celtic forward Kris Commons, pictured training on Tuesday, wants Rangers back in the top flight . However, in a view unlikely to curry unanimous favour amongst Celtic supporters, Commons — who scored in the recent League Cup semi-final between the Glasgow giants — admits he wants the Old Firm fixture back next season. ‘Personally, yes, because the games with Rangers are the best games,’ said the Parkhead forward. ‘They draw the best crowds and a large TV audience for people around the world. It makes people want to get out of bed in the middle of the night in Australia. ‘My mates down south don’t know much about Scottish football but they want to see that game. I love playing in them. ‘There are a lot of fans who are on the fence (about) whether it’s right or wrong but I love them.’ The new board still hope the return of Ibrox icon McCall can spark an improvement as they battle Hibernian for second place. The Ibrox side were hot favourites to finish top of the league at the beginning of the season, but Commons remains unsurprised to see them struggle. Rangers suffered a disappointing 2-2 draw against Alloa on Tuesday - their fifth in a row in the league . Ben Gordon (centre) is congratulated by his team-mates after his goal gave the part-timers a shock lead . ‘I have played in the Championship in England with teams trying to get back up and it’s not easy,’ he continued. ‘Some teams go down from the Premier League and they end up in League one, like Blackpool, Sheffield United and Wednesday. ‘Not only does it affect the players, the manager, coaches and fans, it’s a city thing. It’s a massive thing. ‘It’s very difficult to have the wind knocked out of your sails. ‘When you are struggling — as Rangers are — that’s when you need to call on experience and that’s why they have tried to go with Stuart McCall.’ Commons scored the opener as Celtic secured the League Cup with a 2-0 win over Dundee United on Sunday. The Parkhead side can take a huge step towards their target of a rare domestic treble by beating the Tannadice side again in Wednesday night’s Scottish Cup quarter-final replay at Parkhead. Celtic are bidding to win a domestic treble this season after claiming the Scottish League Cup last Sunday . Jock Stein and Martin O’Neill completed domestic clean sweeps when Rangers were strong, but Commons rubbishes any suggestion of a diminished achievement in the absence of their Glasgow rivals. ‘I think the last time it was done was in an era when money and wages were massive,’ he said. ‘You look at the teams — (Chris) Sutton, (Neil) Lennon, (John) Hartson and (Henrik) Larsson — people who were on fortunes and I think that they got a huge amount of credit for what they did. ‘If we can get across the line and achieve this Treble, I don’t think it should be looked upon as a lesser achievement. It’s the same level.’ Last season’s Player of the Year, meanwhile, plans to take any penalties against United after admitting the on-field spat between James Forrest and John Guidetti over a missed spot-kick on Sunday was regrettable. James Forrest (right) celebrates with John Guidetti after scoring in the League Cup final . ‘I don’t think that has ever happened before at Celtic,’ he said. ‘It’s the sort of thing you see on The Football Years on TV. It was like a (Paolo) di Canio-(Frank) Lampard moment. ‘I can understand from John’s point of view because he has taken a couple of penalties and scored. He has not been on the score sheet a lot of late. He’s a striker and he wants to get goals. ‘But they were not great scenes — probably just an eagerness to score and win. ‘It perhaps put a little dampener on the way that we won. The manager bases a lot on team spirit and team bonding. ‘We are meant to have this good unit as a team but, clearly at the end of the game, it looked as though people were doing things on an individual basis. ‘I don’t think any player should throw a strop on a football field. You should never do that.’"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Kris Commons wants Rangers to get promoted to the Scottish Premiership .\nRangers are third, which would be enough to earn a play-off place .\nThe struggling Ibrox club have not won in their last five league however .\nShould Stuart McCall's side slip to fourth they would miss out play-offs .\nCommons says the Old Firm derbies are the best games to play in ."}]}

It was 10 years ago next month that McKenzie scored for Norwich in a famous 2-0 win over Manchester United at Carrow Road. It has been a decade of ups and downs since for 'Big McK', who endured crippling depression which culminated in a suicide attempt in a Bexleyheath hotel room. But, in boxing, the former Premier League star has found redemption and has been building to this moment since turning professional in June 2013. And, after making a living from taking his chances on the pitch, McKenzie did not let this one pass. Leon McKenzie poses after winning his first title as a professional boxer by at the iconic York Hall . McKenzie won his first title as a professional boxer by claiming the international masters belt . The soon-to-be 37-year-old dominated Croatian fighter Ivan Stupalo during Saturday night's victory . The 36-year- dominated the 10-round super-middleweight contest against Croatian Ivan Stupalo, winning ever round on referee Marcus McDonnell's card, to claim the strap which makes him the mandatory for the southern area title. He said: 'Look at how far I've come. If you look where I was five years ago, I'm lucky to even be here. I want to thank my team, this is a journey not just about me but about so many other people. I want to thank God – this is my second chance, my second career. 'It was my first 10 rounder and I enjoyed it in there. I had to be cautious, I had to move around and use my jab. I stuck to the game plan and now I've got this belt and the journey continues. I'm 37 in May – how many 37-year-olds do you know who could do that?' Former footballer McKenzie celebrates his win with his family at the Iconic York Hall on Saturday night . Boxing talent McKenzie has made the venue is home having fought all but one of his fights there . Boxing talent is very much in the blood for McKenzie. His father Clinton, his trainer and cornerman here at York Hall, is a former British and European light-welterweight champion. His uncle Duke, meanwhile, remains Britain's only modern three-weight world champion. In fact his father made his professional debut in this very ring in Bethnal Green in October 1976. Then, in 1981, Clinton won his British title here too. It was also a happy hunting ground for uncle Duke, who won both of his fights in this famous corner of the East End. Now Croydon-born McKenzie has made this his home with all but one of his previous fights happening here while his opponent was beaten on his only other outing here, when he challenged Andreas Evangelou for the vacant international masters light-heavyweight title. Mckenzie wins his first title in the ring at York Hall and gives his mum a hug as his Dad Clinton looks on . Stupalo, of Split, has since dropped down seven pounds to the super-middleweight division and represented a real step up in class for McKenzie, who, for the first time, was facing an opponent with a winning record. But operating from behind his stiff southpaw jab, McKenzie dominated a cagey first round and occasionally found a home for his straight left to body. He maintained a composed pace in the second, evading Stupalo's rare forward forays. McKenzie forced the Croatian on to the ropes and ran out with a deserved 100-90 points victory . In the fifth, McKenzie began to let his hands go and opened up a cut on his opponent's head with intelligent use of his backhand. It was not until the seventh road that Stupalo got through, but McKenzie just flashed a grin and got back to his business. By the eighth the man from Croatia was spending a lot of time on the ropes but McKenzie was unable to find a finishing blow and instead ran out with a deserved 100-90 points victory.

Tobin School makes a human Pi symbol at the school in Boston during a celebration of Pi Day in 2007 . The best times to celebrate are at 9:26 and 53 seconds, morning and evening. The next time that happens is in March 2115. 'It's a portal into this magical mysterious world of mathematics,' said University of California Berkeley mathematician and author Edward Frenkel. 'Pi is special.' Pi is the constant used to calculate the area of a circle, as in pi times the radius squared, but it appears all over other parts of mathematics. It 'is kind of a basic atomic building block\" for math, said Temple University mathematician and author John Paulos, who was interviewed at precisely 3:14:15 p.m. In some places, Pi Day is celebrated with the edible type of pie. eat your numbers: To celebrate Pi day (the math constant and March 14 or 3-14), Wanda's Pie in the Sky, owned by Wanda Beaver made these pies in 2011 . 'It's a real exciting moment for math enthusiasm,' said Nathan Kaplan, a Yale University math professor, who called it a time for people to 'remember how much fun they found some of the stuff in school.' Kaplan acknowledged that most people don't really recall math as fun, blaming that on how it's taught: 'There's fun stuff out there in the quantitative world.' One interesting aspect of pi is that it is irrational, which means the decimals after 3 go on to infinity with no repeating patterns. Yet in 1897, a bill before the Indiana legislature tried to round it up to 3.2. It fell flat. 'We cannot change it. It's not subject to opinion or taste or time,' Frenkel said. 'How many things like this in the universe mean the same thing to everyone through time and space?' Celebration: A pi-adorned Dominic Vitale watches a performance at Hanover High School during the 2011 celebration of Pi day . The wall Street Journal reports that Dana Emanuel and Byron Clarke decided to hold their wedding on the special day. The date won't come around again for 100 years, so the couple decided  to send circular wedding invitations to  family and friends. The nuptials are even in unison which their engagement date on June 28 last year — 6.28, or two pi. 'The guests are really getting into and are able to laugh about it,' said Clarke. 'It kind of plays into our personalities and humor will hopefully be a big part of the day.'

The House of Commons Commission claimed that offering all 650 ministers a new laptop or iPad Air 2, would actually save money. Liberal Democrat John Thurso, who represents the commission in the chamber, said moving away from Apple's products would be too expensive. Caught in the act: Tory MP Nigel Mills was caught playing Candy Crush on his taxpayer-funded iPad last December . But Shadow Cabinet Office minister Chi Onwurah criticised the decision to lock MPs into the Apple operating system and told Computerworld UK she would have preferred a 'device agnostic' policy. 'As we saw with Nigel Mills and Candy Crush, MPs will be using the games, and the iTunes and other features on the iPad,' she added. 'Locking some of the most powerful people in the country into a platform that most of my constituents can't afford seems like a mistake. And that's without mentioning the tax avoidance issue. I'm pushing for a device independent digital platform for Parliament.' Liberal Democrat John Thurso claimed a move away from Apple's operating system would  incur more costs . Apple iPads have been used across Parliament since a pilot scheme was launched in 2012. Currently 209 MPs have taxpayer-funded tablets with the understanding they use them for working while on the move in Parliament. But last December a Tory MP was caught playing a game on his iPad for more than two hours during a meeting. Nigel Mills escaped punishment after he admitted having a ‘game or two’ of Candy Crush and promised not to do it again. Mr Mills, the MP for Amber Valley in Derbyshire, was supposed to be listening to experts give evidence at a meeting of the Commons Work and Pensions Committee. He had initially said he would merely ‘try’ not to be diverted by the game again, but yesterday afternoon in a statement he said: ‘I guarantee it will not happen again. In 2013, the House of Commons Commission agreed to a recommendation from the administration committee that 'a tablet and a laptop should be the first pieces of equipment offered to all members after the 2015 election'. The Commission assessed a range of tablets with prices ranging from £100 to £600 and where they decided on the Apple iPad Air 2. The cost of supplying the new iPads would be £200,000 a year over the life of the next Parliament. Mr Thurso said the decision to buy the new gadgets was to avoid spending more money on training staff to use non-Apple systems and to reduce hard copy printing in favour of online publication which was already saving more than £3 million annually. The House of Commons Commission said that buying the 650 MPs an iPad Air 2 each, worth £499, will save money . 'Having been in use across Parliament since 2012, iPads are integrated with current business processes and infrastructure,' he said. 'A move away from the Apple operating system (iOS) at this time would incur costs to change these processes. 'Members are able to access the intranet and intranet hosted services via their iPads, they are able to access and annotate committee papers and can download a number of Office apps to access any content held within Office 365. 'There would be a significant change to move existing members to a different tablet operating system. Any departure from iOS would require re-training for the current members using iOS and new training to be developed for the remaining 441 members and all relevant PICT support staff.'"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Every MP in the country is to be offered a brand new iPad worth £499 each .\nThe cost to the tax payer for the iPad Air 2s will be more than £1 million .\nBut the House of Commons Commission claim the move is to save money ."}]}

The 33-year-old even took to going undercover as a dentist for his Oral B endorsement deal . Clarke was made an ambassador for Spartan in 2012 which made much more sense to many of his fans . Clarke's tattoos have also received ridicule for their appearance in the adverts, especially the Arabic writing scrawled up his left arm, loosely translating to 'the pain of discipline is nothing like the pain of disappointment.' Viewers took to asking him to step down as captain due to the embarrassment of the endorsement deal calling him a 'goose' and a 'commercial whore.' Clarke has previously become an ambassador for Australian sport products company, Spartan, in 2012. He received mostly praise for this deal among fans.

But while the handsets they are used in have developed and evolved significantly during that time, SIMs still look the same - albeit smaller - and are still lodged inside devices. A Cambridge computer science experts believes the small microchips' days are numbered and we should be signing into our phones in the same way we log into online accounts. Dr Markus Kuhn from the University of Cambridge said the SIM (stock image) could have been replaced long ago. He believes alternatives include typing in a user identifier and password directly into a phone . 'The fact is, the SIM could have been replaced long ago with a simpler alternative: typing in a user identifier and password directly into the phone is an option - just as we do to access WiFi,' said Dr Markus Kuhn from the University of Cambridge. Or QR codes - the square, 3D barcodes - are a more convenient alternative for smartphones with cameras, where an app can read the details encoded in the QR straight from the camera. Dr Kuhn continued: 'SIM cards were a useful feature when they came onto the market in 1991. 'At the time mobile phones were bulky devices, usually mounted in cars [and] a SIM would help customers quickly and easily transfer their phone number and contacts from one phone to the next, without the need to type in long identifiers and access codes each time. Alternatively,  QR codes (example pictured) are a  convenient way to store and access data using a smartphone camera . 'But the days of huge or rented car phones are gone, and today smartphones are lightweight, personal devices that we entrust with passwords to many sites and services - access to WiFi, email, social networks, app stores, and online shopping.' He believes replacing SIMs with passwords or extra software would make it easier to have multiple several pay-as-you-go contracts from different providers on a single phone. They could subsequently switch to the cheapest rate depending on where they were, and apps that functioned as brokers could even negotiate which network to select based on best price automatically. Customers would also not be hindered by the complicated switching process currently used when moving phone numbers across networks. In terms of security, Dr Kuhn explained that SIM cards are also vulnerable to attack. Gemalto, the Dutch SIM card manufacturer, was reportedly the victim of an NSA and GCHQ attack for example. Although the firm said that little information was stolen, 'the reality is that SIM cards are now more of a drawback than a benefit,' added Dr Kuhn. The University of Cambridge lecturer also believes the time is right to switch from SIM cards because modern cryptographic techniques mean passwords no longer have to be very long. A Global System for Mobile (GSM) network was established in the late 1980s to create a communication standard throughout Europe. Communications. In 1991, German smart-card maker Giesecke & Devrient sold the first 300 SIM cards to Finnish operator Radiolinja. In 2014 5.2 billion SIMs (different sizes shown) were sold making them lucrative for manufacturers . SIM stands for subscriber identity module, which is the name of the integrated circuits found in the chips. Phone numbers and other files can be added to these chips too. These modules store data that lets a phone identify who, and which device, it belongs to and connects it to the network. Each card has a serial number as well as network information, and users can remove the card from one phone and install it in a new one without registering the device. The first SIMs were credit card-sized but has become smaller in recent years. In particular, many new handsets take micro-SIMs and Apple devices use nano-SIMs. The next level is embedded SIMs that can be attached directly to circuit boards. Dr Kuhn said SIM cards were a useful feature when mobile phones were mounted in cars (pictured) and customers wanted to transfer contacts from one phone to the next. But as phones have become more mobile, he believes the technology is outdated and should be replaced with a modern alternative . Password-authenticated key exchange (PAKE) techniques exist that use passwords as a five-digit PIN to create highly secure encrypted connections that even the supercomputers of eavesdropping intelligence agencies can't break. Meanwhile, app stores use modern authentication technique and these could be used to easily transfer all the functionality of a SIM into the phone using an app. 'All that’s needed is a new standard interface for mobile operating systems such as Android or iOS that would allow software to take over the functions of the SIM, said Dr Kuhn. 'Technically, a mobile network login is no more challenging than similar applications such as payment wallets, online banking, digital rights managed content, and so on.' But he recognises that operators prefer the SIM model because they can lock customers to their network, preventing easy access to competitors. Plus, in 2014 5.2 billion SIM cards were sold, making it a lucrative business for manufacturers. 'Manufacturers are understandably against anything that would eliminate their business. Modern SIMs are tiny, difficult to access, and easy to lose once taken out of the phone. 'In fact many users may not even know how to find or remove theirs, because it was inserted for them when they bought the phone. 'This inconvenience allows providers to charge high roaming fees when customers use their phone abroad, when using a local operator would be cheaper.'"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Dr Markus Kuhn said the SIM could have been replaced a long time ago .\nHe believes one alternative could be typing in a user identifier and password directly into a phone - like we do with Wi-Fi networks .\nOr details could be encoded in QR codes photographed by a phone camera .\nThe University of Cambridge lecturer also believes the time is right to switch because of recent advances in cryptographic techniques ."}]}

But Chris Benn and Rebecca Dennis knew they were getting their potential dream home at a bargain – for it cost them just £1. Now, after six months of hard work, they have a property worth £60,000. However the couple are not in a hurry to cash in – which is just as well because to get the two-bed mid-terrace for such a low price they had to agree not to sell it or rent it out for five years. Through the keyhole: This is the refurbished interior of the house that Rebecca Dennis, 21, and Chris Benn, 22, bought for just £1 . Rebecca Dennis, 21, and Chris Benn, 22, pictured left, are quids in after the property in Stoke-on-Trent, pictured right, is now believed to be worth £60,000 . Car factory worker Mr Benn, 22, and his 21-year-old fiancee bought the house in Stoke-on-Trent under a regeneration scheme. The city council has been offering homes for less than the cost of two first-class stamps as it seeks to turn around swathes of its run-down or unwanted housing stock. Buyers receive a £30,000 interest-free council loan to help cover the cost of essential repairs and refurbishment. The new homeowners agree to repay it over ten years – by which time the property will be worth far more than £30,000. Photography student Miss Dennis, who is eight years younger than the average first-time buyer, said: ‘It’s a dream come true to have a house of our own. ‘We would never have been able to afford a house without the scheme. We had been engaged for four years but the prospect of us actually getting married would have been years away if we were saving for a house as well as a wedding. ‘It would have been years before we could have afforded a house alone. ‘My grandad heard about the scheme on TV and suggested we apply. We didn’t fit the criteria during the first round of the scheme. When it reopened a year and a half later, we decided to do whatever it took to get a place. 'My mum and dad wanted us to get married before we got a house together but now they’ve seen it even they agree that it was too good an opportunity to pass up.’ The couple has transformed the property, which was just a shell when they bought it, and turned it into a home that they can be proud of . To qualify for the scheme, Miss Dennis had to get a regular part-time job as Mr Benn is self-employed. Since they moved in last September, they have transformed the property. They had to insulate the whole house and put up a supporting wall on the ground floor. The house had previously been a three-bed, but the pipes for the bathroom ran through the third bedroom, and the council deemed this unsafe. So the couple took a wall out upstairs and boxed off the pipes, making the bathroom bigger and giving the master bedroom a walk-in wardrobe. They put in a new kitchen and redecorated throughout. Mr Benn and Miss Dennis now believe the house is worth around £60,000 as a similar but slightly smaller property in the same road – which was not part of the regeneration project – sold for £55,000. The £3million scheme, funded by the council and central government, was announced in 2012 following the success of similar projects in Liverpool and Rotterdam. It aims to create new communities in areas blighted by empty or boarded-up houses and a high turnover of tenants. So far more than 120 homes have been sold under the scheme and the Cobridge district of the city – the first area to be improved – has been nicknamed ‘Poundland’. The council had to complete some structural work on the mid-terraced property before the couple could begin updating the inside . The small but modern kitchen the couple has installed in their new home after buying the property for just £1 in Stoke-on-Trent . The couple told how they had to fight to get onto the popular council run scheme, which saw Miss Dennis take a third job . Working hard: The couple has said all the hours of work it took to get the two-bedroom property and then to transform it has been worth it . To support the transformation, police have increased the number of patrols, while the Labour-run council has installed CCTV to deter crime and improved other services. Miss Dennis said: ‘Although the area used to be really good it gradually got a bad reputation. But we haven’t had any problems. The streets are really quiet. Our neighbour is great – he’s an older gentleman from Italy who has lived here since the 1950s. ‘We’re looking forward to it becoming a family area again where we can bring up children and people know their neighbours. To get it all sorted is lovely –though we are still working on the garden!’ Miss Dennis and Mr Benn, who have been engaged for four years, have now completed the work on their dream home . Miss Dennis said her parents had hoped she would marry Mr Benn before they moved in together, but they understand this offer was just too good to miss . A proud Miss Dennis said 'We would never have been able to afford a house without the scheme,' as she showed off her new home . The couple took out a £30,000 loan with the council for 10 years to carry out the work on the rundown property .

Monk and new Aston Villa boss Sherwood got to know each other on the same Football Association of Wales Pro-Licence coaching course but the practical takes precedence over the theory on Saturday with three Barclays Premier League points at stake. Sherwood got his break in management at Tottenham first - a position he was unlucky to lose according to Monk - and the former England midfielder has revived Villa's fortunes with three successive wins taking them away from the Premier League danger zone and into the semi-final of the FA Cup. Aston Villa manager Tim Sherwood is preparing for the visit of former coaching coursemate Garry Monk . Sherwood has enjoyed a great start to life since taking over the Villa Park managerial hot-seat . 'He's gone in there and lifted the confidence in the group,' Monk said at his pre-match press conference. 'You need results to do that but they've got very good players there who obviously weren't playing to their full potential before Tim took over. 'But he's had an instant impact. He's a very honest guy, black and white, and that comes across in his interviews and the way he approaches the game. Garry Monk believes himself and Sherwood are very much their own men despite their similarities . 'They're fighting for their lives and we know this game is vitally important to them but it is the same for us. 'We've got our own agenda, we want to achieve our best total of 47 points, and I think you've seen our attitude and focus in our recent games against Tottenham and Liverpool. 'The actual performances deserved more than they got and we need to make sure we replicate that to get the points at Villa.' The pair have both been labelled with the tag of bright, young British managers, even if the 46-year-old Sherwood is actually 10 years older than Monk who celebrated his first anniversary as Swansea boss last month. Swansea manager Monk observes his players during the training session at the Fairwood Training Centre . But Monk says while certain similarities exist between them they are very much their own men with notable differences. 'When Tim came in at Spurs he was already within the club at that time, albeit within a different coaching role,' Monk said. 'I came from a playing background into it and I wouldn't say we were similar managers with the same approach or anything like that. 'But we've got the same desire, commitment and principles and are clear in what we want. 'I'm on the same coaching course as Tim and his views on football are very interesting. Monk believes the former Tottenham Hotspur boss will certainly take Aston Villa forward in the future . 'He's had a fantastic start and I am sure he will take Aston Villa forward after being unlucky at Tottenham. 'He has been given his chance and taken the opportunity really well, he has got them going.' Swansea are seeking to recover from back-to-back league defeats and will come across a former favourite at Villa Park in the shape of Scott Sinclair. The 25-year-old's career nose-dived after his £6.2million move from Swansea to Manchester City in August 2012, Sinclair starting only two league games at the Etihad Stadium before joining Villa on loan in January. Scott Sinclair will come up against his former Swansea teammates during the game at Villa Park . But Sinclair has thrived under Sherwood with three goals in five games and Monk admits it is satisfying to see his former teammate doing well after such a difficult time in his career. 'Scotty has been searching for regular football and it is good to see him playing,' Monk said. 'He did tremendously well for us and we will never forget what he did here. 'It is no surprise to see him playing regular football in the Premier League because he's got the talent to do that.' Sinclair has thrived since arriving at Aston Villa following an unproductive spell with Manchester City ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Swansea manager Garry Monk believes Tim Sherwood has a big future .\nDuo met doing the same FA of Wales Pro-Licence coaching course .\nOn Sunday the course friends do battle with each other at Villa Park .\nMonk admits both are very much their own men despite their similarities ."}]}

Gabi Mann, from Seattle, Washington, feeds the crows that visit her home with peanuts and they bring her gifts in exchange. The youngster has built up collection of more than 70 shiny beads, buttons, pieces of metal, brightly coloured plastic and foam - all left for her by her corvid companions. Scroll down for video and listen to an interview with Gabi . Gabi Mann (above) leaves peanuts out for the crows in her neighbourhood and in return they leave her gifts . Perhaps the most touching is a metal fragment with the word 'best' written on it - one half of a pendant that would be completed by the word 'friend' if reunited with the other part. Among her most prized presents from the neighbourhood crows is a pearl-coloured heart. 'It's showing me how much they love me,' Gabi told the podcast The BitterSweet Life and the BBC. 'They give me all the special stuff you could ever find. 'We know these are from the crows that sometimes they are rusted and dirty and nothing like what a person would carry around. Sometimes we find them on the bird feeder.' The image above shows just some of Gabi's favourite items left for her by birds in exchange for peanuts . Gabi and her mother leave nuts for the crows on a bird feeder (above) along with fresh water in a water bath . Listen to the full podcast by The BitterSweet Life when they visited Gabi and her mother Lisa in Seattle . Her strange relationship with the birds began in 2011 when as a four-year-old she would accidentally drop food. Groups of crows began loitering around the family house hoping to pick up the scraps Gabi left behind. When she started going to school, Gabi began feeding them her lunch. The birds then started lining up to wait for the youngster to get off her bus at the end of the school day. Two years later Gabi and her mother Lisa began leaving food outside in their garden on a daily basis - filling the bird bath with water and leaving peanuts on feeders. Members of the crow family are known to be among the cleverest of birds, but scientists are finding that they may have intelligence that rivals most mammals and even young children. An experiment by the University of Cambridge showed that crows can perform task that three and four-year-old children have difficulty with. Scientists said that, while having very different brain structures, both crows and primates use a combination of mental tools, including imagination and the anticipation of possible future events, to solve similar problems. Other experiments involving the same family of birds found that Caledonian crows can use up to three tools in sequence to obtain food. A study also found that rooks can use stones to raise the level of water in a vessel in order to bring a floating worm into reach. Urban-living carrion crows have been witnessed learning to use road traffic for cracking nuts. The problem-solving creature performed the series of tasks without seeing the fiendishly difficult set up of the course beforehand. The wild crow learned to use individual props during its three months of captivity but had to work out the order in which to use them to complete the challenge and get an inaccessible treat. The animal was later released. In another astonishing test set up by BBC Two, a crow called 007 completed an eight stage puzzle in two and a half minutes. It is one of the most complex tests of the animal mind ever devised. The programme shows 007 the crow completing the eight stage puzzle in approximately two-and-a-half minutes. The individual processes are detailed in this diagram . As Gabi throws the food for the birds, crowds of crows - known as a murder - gather on telephone lines and the nearby fence. In return the crows now leave trinkets on the empty bird feeder - including a broken light bulb, earrings, pieces of Lego, rusted screws, polished rocks and glass beads. Gabi keeps all of the bits in carefully labelled pots and ranks them according to her favourite. She said: 'I think they know my favourite colour - blue. They know that I like Lego and shiny things. They are my type.' Crows are known to be highly intelligent creatures - capable of solving complex puzzles and problems to obtain food. Experts say they can often form strong bonds with people that feed them, but equally can mark out those that they consider a threat. People who have thrown stones at crows or tried to help an injured chick can find themselves mobbed by the creatures for weeks or even years afterwards. In perhaps the most astonishing story, however, Gabi's mother Lisa describes how the crows in their neighbourhood appear to keep watch over the family. Lisa Mann and her daughter Gabi (above) have formed a unique bond with the crows in their neighbourhood . She said that on one occassion she had been out taking photographs of an eagle when she dropped her lens cap on the floor and forgot to pick it up before walking home. She said: 'About an hour later I went back outside to see if I could find it and a crow had put it on the side of one of the bird baths. 'I looked at the surveillence video to find out if it was a crow and you can see it bring it into the yard, walk it to the bird bath and spends time rinsing the lens cap and puts it on the side of the bird bath. It was pretty impressive. 'I'm sure it was intentional. They watch us all the time.' Gabi Mann keeps her collection of gifts from the birds carefully arranged in bags and pots shown above . Gabi herself believes her relationship with the crows has given her a special bond with the natural world and calls herself Nature Girl. She is highly protective of the gifts she has received from the birds, not allowing anyone to touch the trinkets. Her mother said: 'For the most part the common denominator is that they are shiney and small enough to fit in their mouth.' Professor John Marzluff, an expert on avian social ecology at the University of Washington, said he believes the crows may be offering up the gifts as they would to a potential mate. Speaking to The BitterSweet Life podcast, he said: 'I have seen an awful lot of things crows bring people. They do bring gifts whether it is always going to happen, I don't think so. The crows regularly carry gifts, like above, to the water bath and bird feeder in the family's garden after eating . 'Certain individual crows the bond they form with that person might be more of a courtship bond where they are bringing presents like they would for their mates. 'For some people they are dead baby birds and other people they get shiny pendants or beautiful glass.' For anyone hoping to form a bond with some corvids, he has some advice. 'The best thing you can do if you want to form a bond with a crow is to be consistent in rewarding them for whatever the action is with a few peanuts in the shell,' he said. 'They like that food as it is a high fat high energy food and it makes noise when you throw it on the ground.They quickly habituate to your routine. They will follow you.'"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Gabi Mann lives in Seattle, Washington, where local crows bring her gifts .\nThe birds began following her after finding she accidentally dropped food .\nIn 2013 she began leaving food for the neighbourhood crows in her garden .\nThe birds have brought her more than 70 beads, buttons and piece of metal .\nHer most prized present is a heart-shaped pendant left on the feeding table .\nAnother of her favourites is half a friendship pendant with the word 'best'\nExperts say the birds may be bringing her presents as they would a mate ."}]}

Gregor Skoberne, however, takes dedication to the next level by photographing Slovenia's Lake Bohinj every day during summer, and experimenting with paragliding to capture its reflective surface from different angles. The  lake is situated in the Triglav National Park and is the largest permanent lake in Slovenia, perfectly mirroring the surrounding mountains in its waters. Reflective beauty: The stunning Lake Bohinj in Slovenia is less well-known than the popular Lake Bled, and is in pristine condition due to the lack of tourists . Lake Bohinj's orientation results in fascinating light which is perfect for capturing its surrounding mountains and reflections . The 14th century church on the lake is featured on the coat of arms of the  Bohinj municipality and makes for a beautiful keepsake picture . Gregor Skoberne captures Lake Bohinj every day during summer, working at the local tourist information office during that period to be closer . Lake Bohinj is not as famous as popular tourist destination, Lake Bled, but the lack of visitors allows the area to maintain its pristine condition. Photographer Gregor Skoberne, 23, became so spellbound by Lake Bohinj that during summers he now works for the local tourist association in order to be closer to photograph it, as he lives 30 minutes away. 'I was amazed that every day there was something different at the lake, be it light, clouds, fog, reflections or different colors of the leaves,' he said. 'Secondly, I love symmetry and taking reflection shots and Lake Bohinj surrounded with mountains is perfect for that.' Taking to the skies! Gregor enjoys capturing the lake from all angles, including capturing reflections of the clouds while paragliding . To photograph the lake from varied perspectives, Gregor has even gone so far as climbing to the top of nearby waterfall Savica . The lake is situated in the Triglav National Park and is the largest permanent lake in Slovenia . The Slovenian's interest in photography started when he received his first digital SLR camera, his father's Nikon D70s . Gregor now uses a Nikon D5100 with the Nikkor 18-105mm and 12-24mm lenses to capture the stunning Slovenian lake . The Agronomy student, 23, is currently doing a master thesis on visualization of root growth using Time Lapse technique, but hopes to do something professionally that's connected with photography. 'When you see something beautiful in nature, it’s hard to describe another person what you saw and how amazing it was, so I’m trying to capture that on my camera so others can enjoy that too,' he said. One of his most challenging shots occurred following a climb down a stone wall to get to the Savica waterfall. However, the resulting photograph was one that only a true artist would have been able to create. But for Greggor, the best photograph that he has taken of the body of water was while flying above, thanks to the spectacular reflection of the clouds on the lake. His photography can be followed on Facebook and Instagram."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Gregor Skoberne, 23, photographed the 790-acre lake every day during the summer using numerous methods .\nLake Bohinj is less popular than the popular Lake Bled, which attracts many tourists annually .\nThe lake makes for a stunning sight, as it perfectly reflects the snow-capped mountains surrounding the waters ."}]}

Rob Draper had the choice to pick any players from the south teams, in any formation, with no limit on the number of players from each club. Here's how we split the clubs: . South . Arsenal, Aston Villa, Chelsea, Crystal Palace, Leicester City, QPR, Southampton, Swansea City, Spurs, West Brom, West Ham United . North . Burnley, Everton, Hull City, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United, Newcastle United, Stoke City, Sunderland . North vs South. It is perhaps the fiercest argument between the people of England. But without dipping into the political allegiances, property prices and weather, we're sticking to the ultimate debating point – football. This week we are starting a new North vs South debate - who would you pick and who would win? In the NBA, each season they stage an All-Star match that pits the best from the West against the cream of the East. And wouldn't it be fascinating if the Premier League adopted a similar event? Kicking off today, Rob Draper selects his South XI - plus seven subs. A full explanation of the criteria is below. Tomorrow, Joe Bernstein will reveal his North XI. Then on Wednesday, we'll reveal who would win the match thanks to our friends at Football Manager. And, as always, we want you to tell us who you would have picked in your team... Chelsea are top of the Premier League, and they provide the back-bone of our south XI to face the north . Goalkeeper: Thibaut Courtois (Chelsea) Not much to say – either him or David de Gea as goalkeeper of the season, so he’s a natural for the southern No 1 slot. Right back: Nathaniel Clyne  (Southampton) You can wrestle this one back and forth with Branislav Ivanovic who has been superb. But I want a little more pace from my full backs and also am looking to the future by giving Clyne the nod. Centre back: Jose Fonte (Southampton) Everyone thought Dejan Lovren was the mainstay of the Southampton defence – but quietly getting on with his job and holding together the best back four in the country has been Fonte. Thibaut Courtois has proven himself to be a genuine Premier League star in his first season in England . Nathaniel Clyne (left) has earned himself an England spot, and keeps Branislav Ivanovic out of our side . Despite losing his centre back partner last summer, Jose Fonte has marshalled the best defence in the league . Centre back: John Terry (Captain) (Chelsea) Would be ridiculous not to pick him – the best defender in the Premier League at present. Left back: Cesar Azpilicueta (Chelsea) Outstanding. Unfussy and consistently good. Best left back in the Premier League. Defensive midfield: Nemanja Matic (Chelsea) For months he has been the pivotal player for Chelsea in providing balance – in the mould of Patrick Vieira and there is no higher praise. Defensive midfield: Morgan Schneiderlin (Southampton) The steadying influence in Southampton’s rise, all the more remarkable given his disaffection at the start of the season. John Terry - still the best defender in the Premier League - will captain our south XI, as he does Chelsea . Morgan Schneiderlin has bounced back from his uncertain summer to be a mainstay for Southampton . Nemanja Matic, Eden Hazard and Terry have been at the heart of Chelsea's table-topping form this season . Right wing: Alexis Sanchez (Arsenal) Better on the left but nevertheless we need to find room for him in this team. The Sanchez-Cazorla-Hazard axis would terrify any team. Attacking midfield: Santi Cazorla (Arsenal) Appears to be at the absolute peak of his career. Previously you wondered if he had the authority and character to dominate games - now, in his favoured central role, he is showing that. Left wing: Eden Hazard (Chelsea) Potential player of the year. Impish, quick and delightfully skilful. A pleasure to watch – and a much more mature player now after two years in the Premier League. Alexis Sanchez has been superb since signing for Arsenal, and is on the right wing for this side . Hazard's goals have helped take Chelsea top of the league, and he is a player of the season contender . Santi Cazorla has shown his best form since returning to a central role, and will operate behind the striker . Striker: Harry Kane (Tottenham) The easiest pick of all. The south is blessed with the best strikers, so much so that maybe we’ll go 4-4-2 later in the game to get Diego Costa or Olivier Giroud on. But there’s no doubt as to who is in best form at present. Subs . Rob Green (QPR) Petr Cech is probably the next best goalkeeper in the south; but we need a keeper who is sharp and playing regularly and Green has been superb. Harry Kane has emerged this season as one of the Premier League's leading strikers, and is a must-pick . Branislav Ivanovic is unlucky to miss out on a starting spot, but stays on the bench for our south XI . Branislav Ivanovic (Chelsea) Very hard to leave him out. He has been a monster this season, rarely dipping below a 7/10 performance. Laurent Koscielny (Arsenal) I’m a little worried that pace may be an issue for my centre halves – if it is we have Koscielny to cover. Excellent defender as well, despite Arsenal’s frequent debacles. Fabien Delph (Aston Villa) No doubt he will be outraged at being in a southern team – but we had to draw the line somewhere. Just a really good, solid midfielder now. Yannick Bolasie (Crystal Palace) Has come on enormously this season and the Africa Cup of Nations break doesn't appear to have affected him at all – causes problems to every team he plays against. Olivier Giroud (Arsenal) Unfashionably good. His strike rate has been superb and his physicality and ability to hold the ball up is now perhaps the best in the Premier League, alongside... (4-2-3-1): Courtois, Clyne,  Fonte, Terry, Azpilicueta; Matic, Schneiderlin; Sanchez, Cazorla, Hazard; Kane. Subs: Green, Ivanovic, Koscielny, Delph, Bolasie, Costa, Giroud . Diego Costa (Chelsea) The season has ebbed and flowed at times but through it all he has remained the striker you want to have on your side. Edged out by Kane at present but he’ll play a part in this game. Honourable mentions to Gylfi Sigurdsson (Swansea) and Charlie Austin (QPR) who have both been excellent and who will be on the stand-by list. Fabian Delph - though not particularly southern - has done enough this season to earn a spot on the bench . Crystal Palace winger Yannick Bolasie has caused problems for every defender he has faced this season . Olivier Giroud, underrated but efficient, celebrates yet another Premier League goal for Arsenal ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "No place for Diego Costa or Olivier Giroud as Harry Kane leads the line .\nSouthampton and Chelsea - the Premier League's meanest defences - make up the entire back seven of our Southern XI .\nEden Hazard and Alexis Sanchez will play with Santi Cazorla behind Kane .\nWe'll test who is better with help from Football Manager ."}]}

He was turned off by the price tag of American-made clothing: basic crew-neck tees starting at $50, unembellished selvedge denim jeans priced at $250 and up, Oxford cloth button-downs cut and sewn in Los Angeles ranging from $150 to $300. \"It's that effortless design that most guys look good wearing, but it wasn't really happening for anyone except at the higher price point,\" Schnakenberg said. To help shrink the gap, Schnakenberg and his Los Angeles neighbor, Sasha Koehn, started a business with a goal of lowering the barrier to \"made in USA\" fashion. Buck Mason has been up and running since late 2013, offering a focused collection of American-made garments. Prices range from $24 for a t-shirt to $155 for its most expensive pair of jeans, about 25% to 50% less than comparable brands boasting the \"made in USA\" label. How do they keep costs down? By focusing on just a few items and cutting out the middleman so they can sell directly to customers through their website and storefront in Venice, California, they say. With the help of the Internet and social media, they have been able to build their brand and find an audience without the help of chains or department stores. \"It didn't make sense for us to not do it this way,\" Koehn said. \"Maybe that's us being naive or not thinking like a traditional business manager, but I don't see how we could have got this started any other way.\" Brands selling directly to customers is nothing new in retail, and it's still a big gamble for most. Traditional middlemen such as department stores, chains and boutiques help legitimize brands and expose them to consumers faster than brands may be able to build their own fan bases. But some small businesses are finding the cost of that exposure too onerous. By selling directly to consumers, brands increase their margins, control inventory based on their own projections and don't have to worry about returns from retail store customers. They also have complete control over pricing and may be able to offer lower prices to consumers, said Jack W. Plunkett, CEO of market research company Plunkett Research. Fueled by venture capital investors, there has been strong growth in new direct to consumer brands, and not only in clothing, Plunkett said. But very few actually manufacture in the United States because of the high cost of doing business, especially compared with global competitors. For Buck Mason, manufacturing in the United States is a matter of principle and direct to consumer a means to that end, Schnakenberg said. \"It's that idea of looking at our product and taking pride in creating something from scratch. We may not sell 100 million t-shirts, but we can say we're to create one thing and make it all here and be part of the process,\" Schnakenberg said. To make direct to consumer work, Buck Mason and other plucky entrepreneurs are mixing aspects of traditional business models with customized approaches to production and marketing, taking on much of the work typically done by outside parties. They sell through their own websites and stores, retaining absolute control over branding and merchandising. They build audiences through social media, using it as a branding tool and a forum to seek customer feedback on styles and colors, forming relationships in the process. But it takes more populating a Web store or Instagram feed with aspirational images of attractive people to reduce margins. Brands offering specialty products that stand out have a better chance of surviving, depending on the product and its place in the global market, Plunkett said. \"Overall, this is positive for the sustainability of U.S. manufacturing, but there are many cases in which it will be extremely difficult to have competitive prices when manufacturing here,\" he said. Instead of designing various products in different colors and styles, fledgling brands have found success in getting just a few items right, developing a cult-like following and adding products based on customer feedback. It's a model that has worked for Adele Berne and Mike Kuhle, who launched the e-commerce arm of their New York storefront, Epaulet, in 2008 with a button-down shirt for men and women made in the city. From day one, they have sold directly to consumers through their website and store, using social media to build a fan base that enjoys geeking out as much as they do over fabric origins and stitching details. Since then, they have expanded to accessories and footwear, and they offer custom suiting and shirts. Along the way, they have earned a reputation for offering quality products sourced and made in the United States and Europe. They partner with esteemed brands including shoemaker Alden and suit maker Southwick on products and offer a handful of other brands for sale. Through social media, Kuhle says, Epaulet has cultivated a fan base interested in the stories behind the brand, its creators and its manufacturing partners. Their customers see the value in paying more for products made in the U.S. or Europe, and they keep coming back. \"Your product has to be unique, and it has to be something people want, whether it's filling a void for something people don't know they want yet, or it's something you see in market that you could do better,\" Berne said. Buck Mason launched with a simple T-shirt, working with a knitter in Los Angeles to develop a slub cotton before sending it to a mill outside the city. When it sold out, the company started working on a five-pocket selvedge denim jean sourced from North Carolina and cut and sewn in Los Angeles. It's an a la carte approach to production that takes more time and attention than the full-package manufacturing typically used by larger brands to fill big orders under one roof. The upside is that it keeps shipping costs down and allows Buck Mason to respond faster to market demands by placing small orders with a quick turnaround. Chris Sutton started out making one pair of jeans at a time in his Cincinnati, Ohio, workshop. As demand for Noble Denim grew, Sutton and his wife, Abby, scaled up production by partnering with a Tennessee factory that, like most remaining textile manufacturers, had seen better days. As the Suttons learned more about the factory's history and the town it once supported, they realized it needed more business to create sustainable employment opportunities. It was \"hipster and naive\" of them to think they could make a significant impact with small runs of premium jeans, Abby Sutton said, and they started pondering new products. They tested the waters with a small run of sweatshirts. After selling out within days, the couple decided to launch a Kickstarter campaign to raise funds for a new business. Sweatshirts sold under the Victor label will be made from organic cotton in the same factory as Noble Denim. Unlike Noble, which is sold in a few stores, Victor will be sold directly to consumers through the company's website and its brick and mortar store in Cincinnati. Cutting out the middleman allows Noble to control its brand instead of relinquishing control to wholesalers and create \"stability\" in terms of sales expectations, Abby Sutton said. \"Everyone is oddly reliant on each other but not in way that encourages innovation.\" It also creates a quicker \"feedback loop\" through which the Suttons can listen and respond to customer feedback. That's how they heard from people who said they could not afford to support the \"made in USA\" movement even though they wanted to. Through Victor, whose products range from $25 for a tee to $85 for a hooded sweatshirt, the Suttons hope to rehab American-made style's reputation as exclusively high-end and inaccessible, she said. \"There are people who value the idea of U.S.-made but have never taken the step,\" she said. \"If we can make it for the same price as a Gap sweatshirt, hopefully people will see it as easy choice.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "American-made clothing brands try to cut out middleman, selling directly to consumers .\nPros include smaller margins that can lower prices for consumers .\nSocial media make finding customers easier, but it's still an uphill battle ."}]}

The groundsman was dragging a heavy roller around the goal-mouth part of the pitch at the home of Brokenhurst FC when the bulky contraption firmly struck the left-hand post. Such was the force of the collision it caused the goal frame to snap at the join of the crossbar, leaving it dismantled on the turf. Brockenhurst's home clash against Bournemouth Poppies was postponed when the groundsman demolished the goalposts with a heavy roller - the home team were unable to get replacement posts in time . The damage to the goalposts was so bad it meant yesterday's Sydenhams Wessex League clash between Brockenhurst and Bournemouth Poppies had to be cancelled. Pete Lynes, chairman of Brockenhurst FC, told MailOnline: 'I heard about it on the day itself and at first I didn't believe it. 'But when I went down I saw the damage to the post and I immediately telephoned the manufacturers to see if they would be able to provide replacements. 'But they could not deliver new ones until the middle of next week, so we had to call the game off. It's just one of those things.' A spokesman for Bournemouth said: 'We are disappointed, especially after our midweek win, but it is one of those freak things that cannot be helped.'

Bournemouth Poppies had been hoping to emulate their mid-week success, when they defeated Andover Town 3-1. Their impressive form is in contrast to Brockenhurst who have lost their previous five matches - so the week off may have been a welcome relief.

Mitchelle Blair, 35, appeared in court via video feed from police lockup for her arraignment today and entered a plea of not guilty. In setting the high bond, 36th District Court Magistrate Renee McDuffee said 'the charges in this matter are so heinous', while the prosecution said Blair could face two counts of first-degree murders once an autopsy determines how they died. The children, Stoni Ann Blair and Stephen Gage Berry died, are believed to have been 13 and 9, respectively, when they died. Investigators suspect the children died up to two years ago. Held: Mitchelle Blair, 35, appears via video link from police lockup Thursday for her arraignment. She entered a plea of not guilty for charges of child abuse after the bodies of two of her children were found in her freezer . Mother: Mitchelle Blair, seen here in a photo from her Facebook, has been charged with five counts of child abuse. The bodies of two of her children were allegedly found in her chest freezer on Tuesday . Daughter: Blair's daughter, Stoni Ann Blair, is seen with her father Alexander Dorsey. Police sources allege Blair killed the girl a year ago and put her body in the freezer . Scene: Court officers serving an eviction notice at Blair's home opened the freezer and found the bodies of her daughter, Stoni Ann Blair, and her son, Stephen Gage Berry . Investigation: Prosecutors believe that when they died, Stoni was 13 years old and Stephen was 9. Police are seen at the low-income apartment complex near downtown Detroit on Tuesday . Police sources told The Detroit News earlier this week that Blair confessed to killing the two, after reportedly discovering they had been molesting a younger relative. Blair allegedly killed her son two years ago and then her daughter in 2014 after learning of the abuse. According to WXYZ, she strangled her son and tortured her daughter. She has been ordered not to have any contact with her two surviving children - a 17-year-old girl and 8-year-old boy - who have been placed in protective custody. Blair and the children were living in a nearby apartment when an eviction crew arrived her apartment on Tuesday near downtown Detroit. It was then officers discovered the bodies buried deep in the chest freezer by the front door, according to reports. The children's bodies were still thawing Thursday and the medical examiner was planning to conduct the autopsies on them Friday. Blair faces an April 2 probable cause hearing and April 9 preliminary examination. So far she  has been charged with five counts of first-degree child abuse, one of which could land her in prison for life, said Maria Miller, a spokeswoman for the Wayne County prosecutor's office. Neighbors said they hadn't seen the dead children in about a year. None of the four children was enrolled in Detroit schools, and friends said their mother was home-schooling them. Tributes: A woman walks past notes and tous left on the door at at the family's home on Wednesday . 'Heaven is where you belond': Teddy bears and notes are left at the town home in Detroit on Wednesday, a day after the bodies of two children were found in the freezer inside . Under state law, Michigan parents have the right to homeschool their children. The state was not notified that Blair's children were being homeschooled this year, but such registration is voluntary. Neighbors say Blair has lived in the complex at least 10 years. She was unemployed and having money troubles, and she had gotten behind on her rent. Neighbors said they knew about the impending eviction. Court records show a judgment filed last month against her for $2,206 owed to the complex. Despite her money and other problems, friends call her a good mother. Blair is known throughout the complex of low-income townhomes as 'Angel'. But neighbors rarely saw the four children outdoors. In announcing the charges against Blair, Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy said 'the alleged facts in this case present examples of why we must all be diligent and involved citizens.' Online: Blair posted this photo  in January . Bailiffs first found the girl's body in the chest freezer while entering the apartment to serve the eviction. They then called police, who discovering the boy's body. Detroit Police Chief James Craig said the mother was taken into custody after an apartment resident informed officers she was staying with someone at a different home inside the complex, according to the Detroit News. Blair describes herself as 'Loyal to my babies' on her Facebook page. On January 30, the posted a photo with the message: 'There is no greater blessing than being called MOM.' Blair filed a paternity suit in 1999 which resulted in a man being ordered to pay child support. She then filed another suit in 2007 against another man which had the same result. Her brother Marlon Blair told the Detroit News earlier this week: 'It's too early to even say what this could be, or to make any judgments. 'She didn't have any emotional problems from what I'm aware of. I don't know what to say about this.' Assistant Chief Steve Dolunt told the Detroit News: 'This is a terrible situation.' No weapons were discovered after the apartment was searched. Neighbor Shanetria Lanier, 21, told the Detroit News Blair home-schooled her children and 'that's why no schools were wondering where they were'. There is no record of the children attending classes, according to a Detroit Public Schools official. Lanier told the newspaper: 'When people asked her where her other two kids are, she said they were at their aunt's house.

Weston, who turned 28 this week, was on board Benbane Head in the penultimate race of the day, the Fulke Walwyn Kim Muir Challenge Cup for amateur riders, when he fell at the fourth from home. Benbane Head was in the middle of the field, and the jockey appeared to be struck by several following horses. Tom Watson, pictured in 2010, was airlifted to hospital after he was kicked by horses . He was immediately treated by doctors before being taken to the course’s medical centre and then flown by air ambulance to Bristol’s Southmead Hospital. Cheltenham spokeswoman Sophia Brudenell said that he was conscious and breathing at the time, and that he was subject to ongoing assessment and treatment. Benbane Head is trained by Gloucestershire-based Martin Keighley, who said shortly afterwards: ‘Tom’s not quite with it at the moment, but at least he is conscious and he seems much better than he initially did.’ The accident caused a 15-minute delay to the running of the final race of the day, the St Patrick’s Derby, which is run in aid of the Injured Jockeys’ Fund. While the horse escaped unscathed, a further update on Weston’s condition is expected on Friday morning. Two years ago in the same race, leading amateur jockey JT McNamara, from Limerick, was left paralysed after suffering a serious neck injury when thrown from his horse, Galaxy Rock.

The 51-year-old former European middleweight champion has started chemotherapy, walking to a hospital near his south London home for each session to keep fit. The determined former boxer, who has never smoked, vowed that he would conquer cancer. Boxing champion Errol Christie (left) has revealed he is battling lung cancer in what he says is the toughest fight of his life . He told the Sunday People: 'I am just starting my treatment. I've had my first round of chemo and it has really been tough but I am going to beat this.' Christie's son Louie, 26, said that his father had been unwell for a while but was only recently diagnosed with lung cancer. Louie, who is also a boxer, said: 'It is a real shock because my dad has always been fit and has never smoked or drunk – it seems so unfair. 'Being who he is, he didn’t want to make a fuss when he felt unwell. He thought it would clear up. 'It was a real shock when he got the results back. We were both stunned. But he is ­remaining positive and has vowed to beat it. He is determined to get well. I’m very proud of how he is coping.' Christie, pictured during his memorable bout with Mark Kaylor (right) in 1985, has started chemotherapy . Explosive: Christie (right) and Kaylor got up close and personal while promoting their clash in 1985 . Christie was training amateur boxers, including X Factor host Dermot O'Leary, at Gym Box in London until last week but has been forced to put that on hold to focus on fighting his illness. Christie's son was due to make his boxing debut as a featherweight next month but this has now been put on hold because of his father's diagnosis. During his boxing career, the former champion fought 41 bouts, taking 32 wins including 26 by knockout. He suffered eight defeats, most memorably to Mark Kaylor in 1985. The infamous match was preceded by an ugly scuffle at the pre-fight conference, and when the boxing finally got underway Christie lost in nine rounds in a match where both men were floored. Although he boxed on into the early 90s, he was never the same fighter again and hung up his gloves in 1993. Christie's greatest success came in 1982 when he defeated Mow Gruciano in what was then East Germany to take the European middleweight belt. The father-of-one was involved in a scuffle with fellow former boxer Lloyd Honeyghan last October during a Boxing Writer's Club dinner at the Savoy Hotel in London. Frank Bruno had to step in to separate the pair after they squared up, but no punches were thrown. Christie said at the time: 'There was a bit of an incident with Lloyd. I don't know what planet he was on but it's different from the rest of us. No punches were thrown. He was just mouthing off, acting the big shot.'"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Errol Christie has revealed that he has been diagnosed with lung cancer .\nFormer European middleweight champion, 51, has started chemotherapy .\nThe boxer, who has never smoked, vowed that he would conquer cancer ."}]}

The 22-year-old woman, identified only by her first name Laura, was held down in a church in Buenos Aires, Argentina as Bishop Manuel Acuna, 52, ordered a demon to leave her body. As she screamed 'no, no' and shouted abuse at one of the women holding her down, Bishop Acuna was heard muttering: 'Leave, leave her now.' Pictures have emerged of a woman being pinned to the ground while writhing in pain as priests performed an exorcism . The 22-year-old woman (pictured), identified only by her first name Laura, was held down in a church in Buenos Aires, Argentina . Bishop Manuel Acuna (pictured), 52, stood over Laura and ordered a demon to leave her body . Before the exorcism, locals gathered at the Lutheran Charismatic Church praying for her soul and redemption. Bishop Acuna told them: 'The demon exists. He's not an idea, he's not a theory, he's not something abstract. 'The devil is a personality and therefore has a strategy. We are talking about something terrifying, a fallen angel. The devil is not a metaphor. 'The devil is something real that Jesus Christ faced. The devil looks for the perdition of the human being and for this he will use any possible evil instrument.' Laura (pictured) screamed 'No, No' and shouted 'Whore' at one of the women holding her down . Intervention: Bishop Acuna was heard muttering 'leave, leave her now' as the woman was being pinned down . Locals said they could hear Laura 'screaming and crying' from inside a chamber at the church in Buenos Aires . Laura was then led into a chamber where church helpers held her to the ground. Local man Augustus Amador Arevalo, 32, who had gone to pray for her said: 'We could hear her screaming and crying and we prayed for her deliverance. 'She was a good girl but turned bad when the devil possessed her. She had to be exorcised, she had to be free.' The exorcism came to an end when she suddenly gave a strangled cry and closed her eyes, falling backwards exhausted.

She could be seen wiping away tears as the priest once again made the sign of the cross over her body. Bishop Acuna said: 'Thank God, we've recovered a daughter of God. You haven't seen a major exorcism. 'This was a group of demons similar to the ones that Jesus faced.

I'm in Valencia, Spain's third largest city. Not for the Las Fallas festival (a huge affair every March when giant papier-mache figures of politicians are burned amid lively street celebrations), but for its other claim to fame - it is the home of paella. Luis is a top chef who leads paella-making classes. But first I have to get the ingredients. Dinner is served: Paella originated in Valencia, using ingredients which could be sourced cheaply and locally . The central market is in a glorious art nouveau building in the old quarter, with more than 500 stalls selling every Spanish food imaginable. I buy an 'arrangement' of rabbit and chicken portions from a butcher. Then I choose three different types of beans. Paella Valenciana was created from what was easily available to local farmers. This meant rice from the local paddy fields, and beans, rabbit and chicken from their land. It's wrong to add peas, as we Brits do, apparently. Under Luis's watchful eye, I learn how to chop the meat and cook it and the beans in different parts of the pan. I sieve fresh tomato and dabble in smoked pimento for flavour. The secret is about how to put the rice into the water. Luis tells me to add it in two straight lines in the form of a cross (seemingly, for perfect absorption). I add fresh rosemary, remembering to remove it after ten minutes. It seems to work and in around 20 minutes my glossy, golden rice dish is complete. Delicious, though I say so myself. Luis awards me my diploma: I am now a 'paella ambassador'. If you want to know more about this famous dish and its variations, contact Patrick Waller. Originally from Bromley, he moved to Valencia 23 years ago when he fell in love with a local, Julia Espin. A real mixed bag: True paella can contain seafood and rabbit - but should never feature peas . They run the Paella Project, taking in all aspects of buying fresh produce at the market, cooking classes, wine tastings and a visit to Xativa in the hills with lessons and meal preparation outdoors. You can also explore the famous rice fields of the Albufera National Park, just 15 minutes outside Valencia. They blew me away. You can take a boat trip on the vast lagoon or enjoy the pine-fringed, wild beaches and restaurants of nearby El Saler village. Valencia has fantastic white beaches, too, just five minutes from the city centre. There are endless orange tree patios (proper orange juice everywhere); walks along the former Turia riverbed; the Unesco listed Lonja (silk hall), which dates to1548; and superb shopping, including five El Corte Ingles department stores. Balconies of intricate metal designs and specialist cafes called horchaterias, with marble-topped tables serving a traditional Valencian drink made from tiger nuts and sugar, remind me this is the real Spain. Kirker Holidays (020 7593 1899, www.kirkerholidays.com) has three nights at Melia Plaza Hotel from £559 per person, based on two sharing, including flights from Gatwick, private transfers and B&B. Paella classes cost from £50 (www.escueladearrocesypaellas.com); four-day Paella Project from £475, including accommodation (www.thespanishthymetraveller.com)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Valencia, in the south-east of Spain, is the traditional home of paella .\nPaella Valenciana was created from what was easily available to farmers .\nValencia has fantastic beaches an easy hop from from the city centre ."}]}

And after that unfortunate incident after just 63 seconds, City cruised to a 3-0 win to trim Chelsea's lead at the top to three points. Arsenal stayed in touch as Olivier Giroud scored twice at Newcastle United, while Harry Kane grabbed his first Premier League hat-trick in Tottenham's 4-3 win over Leicester City. There were also wins for West Ham, Swansea, Southampton and Crystal Palace. Each week, Sportsmail collates the ratings of our reporters around the grounds to bring you the Premier League team of the day. GOALKEEPER - Boaz Myhill (Manchester City vs WEST BROM) 8 . Down to 10 men after just two minutes against a City side determined to prove a point after a recent slump, West Brom were really up against it. Myhill led the resistance with a succession of excellent saves, in the end limiting the damage to just three goals. West Brom goalkeeper Boaz Myhill gets a grip on Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero . DEFENCE - Jores Okore (ASTON VILLA vs Swansea City) 7 . The Denmark international produced one of the more positive performances as Aston Villa slumped to a disappointing home defeat at the hands of Swansea. Jores Okore tussles with Bafetimbi Gomis during Saturday's match at Villa Park . DEFENCE - Ashley Williams (Aston Villa vs SWANSEA CITY) 7 . At the opposite end, Williams and his central defensive partner Federico Fernandez produced assured performance to earn a clean sheet and keep the Swans in the top half of the table. Swansea captain Ashley Williams talks to Bafetimbi Gomis during their 1-0 win at Villa Park . DEFENCE - John O'Shea (West Ham vs SUNDERLAND) 7 . After the early withdrawal of Wes Brown through injury, O'Shea stepped up and drew on his extensive leadership to marshal the Sunderland defence. Alas, they couldn't quite hold out and claim a precious point in Dick Advocaat's first game in charge. John O'Shea attempts to block an effort from West Ham's Diafra Sakho . DEFENCE - Neil Taylor (Aston Villa vs SWANSEA) 7.5 . A hard-fought win for Swansea in which Taylor's block of a close-range Gabriel Agbonlahor effort early in the second-half proved crucial. Taylor also delivered plenty of crosses from the left, setting up Bafetimbi Gomis, who would later prove Swansea's match-winner. Neil Taylor slides in on Aston Villa's Leandro Bacuna during Swansea's win at Villa Park . MIDFIELD - Charlie Adam (STOKE CITY vs Crystal Palace) 7.5 . Was his usual dogged self in the Stoke midfield but couldn't inspire a victory as Palace emerged from the Britannia with all three points. Charlie Adam slides in on Jason Puncheon during Stoke's defeat to Crystal Palace . MIDFIELD - David Silva (MANCHESTER CITY vs West Brom) 8.5 . The outstanding player in City's comfortable win over West Brom, which cut Chelsea's lead to three points - at least temporarily. The Spaniard tormented the Baggies defence throughout and scored City's third goal when he turned in Stevan Jovetic's shot. David Silva shoots for goal during Manchester City's win over West Brom on Saturday . MIDFIELD - Nabil Bentaleb (TOTTENHAM vs Leicester) 7.5 . A crazy game at White Hart Lane but Bentaleb stood out for his performance in the Spurs midfield, protecting the defence and picking passes to free the front-runners. Was fortunate the referee didn't spot a slap on Leonardo Ulloa, however. Nabil Bentaleb holed off a challenge from Leicester's Matthew James during Saturday's 4-3 win . FORWARD - Wilfried Bony (MANCHESTER CITY vs West Brom) 8 . A day to savour for the Ivorian, who opened his account for Manchester City with a well-taken goal after 27 minutes. Having been involved in the game-changing sending off after just two minutes, Bony broke the deadlock with a neat flick turn and finish. Wilfried Bony celebrates after opening the scoring in City's 3-0 home win over West Brom . FORWARD - Olivier Giroud (Newcastle United vs ARSENAL) 8 . A striker in a real purple patch, Giroud continued his hot streak with a double up at Newcastle to take his run to nine in his last nine matches. His first may have been a fortuitous deflection on Danny Welbeck's header but his second was an effortless header. Olivier Giroud celebrates after scoring the second of his two goals for Arsenal at Newcastle United . FORWARD - Harry Kane (TOTTENHAM vs Leicester) 8.5 . Undoubtedly the player of the day, Kane claimed his first Premier League hat-trick with a bravura performance against Leicester at the Lane.

Reverend Creflo Dollar, 53, is the head of the World Changers Church International, a Christian ministry centered around the prosperity gospel, which preaches that God wants to bless the faithful with earthly riches. The televangelist, who is one of the most prominent African-American preachers in the United States, this week put a five-minute video up on his website pledging for donations for a Gulfstream G650 - which claims to be the fastest plane ever built in civilian aviation - so that 'World Changers Church International can continue to blanket the globe with the Gospel of grace'. Dollar - who is known to own two Rolls Royce's and multi-million dollar homes in Atlanta and New Jersey - last hit headlines in 2012, after being arrested for allegedly attacking his 15-year-old daughter. Open palm: Reverend Creflo Dollar of the World Changers Church International wants 200,000 people from across the world to each donate '$300 or more' so that he can buy the world's fastest private jet . Battling: This notice has been posted on the church's website, pleading for donations so that Dollar can 'continue reaching a lost and dying world for the Lord Jesus Christ' Goal: Dollar wants to spend the $65 million he hopes to make in donations on a Gulfstream G650 business jet, a plane favored by billionaires that bills itself as the fastest plane built in civil aviation . Televangelist: Creflo Dollar is the founder of World Changers Church International, which has about 30,000 members and an 8,500 seater amphitheater in Atlanta called the 'World Dome' Among the billionaires who own a Gulfstream G650 are Steve Jobs' wife Lauren Powell Jobs, Wynn Resorts CEO Steve Wynn add Nike co-founder Phil Knight. There is a long waiting list for the aircraft, with the next round of planes not due until 2017. According to the Creflo Dollar Ministry's website: 'The ministry's current airplane, was built in 1984, purchased by the ministry in 1999 and has since logged four million miles. 'Recently on an overseas trip to a global conference, one of the engines failed. Arrested: The Reverend was charged in 2012 for allegedly attacking his teenage daughter . 'By the grace of God, the expert pilot, who's flown with Creflo for almost 20 years, landed the plane safely without injury or harm to any passengers.' The Christian Post first reported that Dollar insisted that he needs the jet to continue sharing the word of Jesus. He preaches all over the world, but primarily works out of a 8,500-seat amphitheater in Atlanta called the 'World Dome', satelliting the sermons to churches all over the country. The website pledge continued: 'Believe it or not, there are still millions of people on this planet who have never heard of Jesus Christ and know nothing of His greatness.' 'Our hearts desire to see precious lives changed and snatched out of darkness and thrust into His marvelous light! 'We need your help to continue reaching a lost and dying world for the Lord Jesus Christ,\" the appeal continued before asking supporters of the ministry to sow a $300 seed into the airplane fund, billed Project G650.' However, according to Financial Juneteenth, a Report of the Senate Finance Committee, Minority Staff Review of WCCI, found that Dollar's current jet had also been used for a variety of vacation flights, including stops in Las Vegas, Nevada, Miami, Florida and Hawaii, citing Federal Aviation Administration figures. Dollar has refused over the years to disclose his salary, but has an estimated net worth of $27 million. He has five children to his wife, Taffi, who he married in 1985. Couple: Dollar and his wife, Taffi (pictured together) were married in 1985 and have five children . Home: Dollar and his family primarily live in this multi-million dollar in Fayettville, Georgia, south of Atlanta . In June 2012, his 15-year-old daughter called 911, saying her father repeatedly punched and choked her at their Atlanta home. The teenager also said it wasn't the first time something like that had happened and that she felt threatened living in the house. Dollar was arrested and charged with family brutality and juvenile cruelty. The charges were later dropped, but he was required to complete a three-month anger management program. At his next sermon, two days following the arrest, Dollar spent several minutes addressing the incident, starting with: 'I will say this emphatically: I should have never been arrested.' Dollar has strenuously denied the accusations, saying it was a family argument with 'heightened emotions'. Damaged: Dollar says the church's current plane, bought in 1999, is broken and needs to be replaced, or he will be unable to continue working around the world . Dollar's wife Taffi has been known to introduce her husband at his sermons. During her address, she claims Dollar comes 'face to face with God, like Moses'. She also includes an admonition saying that 'every tongue that rises up against' (Dollar) 'will be struck down', Financial Juneteenth reported.

And he is clearly smitten with his girlfriend of four years. In an interview with the Sunday Times this weekend, the 31-year-old Irishman says that while many couples, particularly those in the limelight, might have seen their relationship foundering under the pressure of work commitments, they didn't have that problem. 'You meet someone, you fall in love, then you can only see them over Skype or phone calls or texts and emails. And you have this whole other side to your relationship and it's... it was fun. He continues: 'We knew we really wanted to be together. And knew if we could do that, we could tackle a lot more. It was never: God, this is hard, bloody hell, we need to review this. This sucks. We never questioned it; it was great. So we had that from the beginning...' Early on in the couple's relationship, Greene painted a similar picture, previously admitting to the Irish Times that they are both resigned to periods apart: 'Well, that's the job we do. We'll always travel with work. Skype is great, and we're getting on brilliantly. 'It's been actually quite easy because we're both working. If I wasn't working it would be a lot harder.' Irish eyes: Greene, who was born in Cork, starred opposite Daniel Radcliffe in The Cripple of Innishmaan and was nominated for both a Laurence Olivier award and a Tony Award for her performance . So, who exactly is Sarah Greene and how did she successfully woo the man that is currently capturing millions of hearts while playing Cornish legend Captain Ross Poldark in the hit BBC series? To date, the Cork-born actress is best known for playing opposite Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe in The Cripple of Inishmaan. Greene played the role of Helen McCormick in the play and trod the boards in the London production in 2013 before transferring to Broadway the following year. It was a role that garnered plenty of praise from critics; nominations for Laurance Olivier and Tony Awards followed. The actress is currently starring in Penny Dreadful, a Dublin-based Sky Atlantic horror show about the cheap-to-buy, sensationalist books of the same name which were published in the 19th century. Masterpiece! Turner has admitted to using baby oil to make his body look perfect on screen . Although the Poldark star has said he had to seriously hit the gym to perfectly hone his physique, the make-up department had another trick to ensure his body looked suitably granite-like for the hit BBC show. Turner says that some kind of 'baby oil' was used to make his muscles ripple perfectly for the camera. And Captain Poldark's striking eyes might suggest Turners' own peepers were enhanced with make-up but that's not the case. He told the Times that while he had to wear eyeliner for 'some scenes', he definitely doesn't lush up his lashes with mascara. A role in the Canadian-Irish television series Vikings also raised the Irish beauty's profile and it seems Hollywood now beckons too. Later this year, the striking brunette is set to start work on a comedy, playing opposite Bradley Cooper and Sienna Miller. Born in Cork, Greene trained in Dublin, graduating from the Gaiety School of Acting in 2006 after becoming obsessed with being an actress after going to watch a local panto. She said: 'My parents took myself and my sister to see the Christmas panto Red Riding Hood in the Cork Opera House and I was sold, all I wanted to do was get up on the stage!' The couple met after working together in the play Titus Andronicus but it was a slow burn before a relationship developed. He told Irish Weekend Magazine in 2013: 'I did a play with her about eight years ago Titus Andronicus, directed by Selina Cartmell. 'I played Demetrius, her character wasn't a named character but we met on that. 'It was all very platonic and we never hooked up or anything, but that's how we got to know each other. And then years later we just met again and it just sort of took off.' His brooding good looks aren't always so refined either. The actor has confessed that he is 'inherently lazy' and only really got in shape for Poldark as filming start dates approached. 'I worked hard for six weeks, killing myself in the gym, watching what I eat and staying away from bad food. But I would never, ever do all that if I wasn't prepping for a role. That's the only time it just happens,' he explained. 'I'm not like that now. I'm back to my usual soft self.' It hasn't always been plain sailing on the love front either. Speaking to the Daily Mirror about being hurt by a past girlfriend, the actor said: 'Yes, it's happened to me. I've been upset, my heart's been broken. 'I don't know anyone on the planet who hasn't had their heart broken. Love is love. 'It's the purest and rawest thing we have in life and everyone experiences it.' He may have found happiness with Greene, but talks of engagement are too hasty. Last week, she told Irish entertainment websites and Goss.ie and Evoke.ie while at an event in Dublin: 'I'm not engaged.'"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Aidan Turner has been dating fellow actor Sarah Greene for four years .\nThe Irish couple say they've 'never questioned' having to work apart .\nGreene won plaudits in The Cripple of Innishmaan with Daniel Radcliffe .\nShe's set to star in a new comedy with Sienna Miller and Bradley Cooper ."}]}

And these stark pictures show the mammoth task they face to restore the much-loved building, designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh, to its former glory. The Glasgow-based architects were chosen thanks to their extensive track record in both restoring and reinvigorating major historic buildings - as well their work on buildings designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh. Work is expected to begin in the spring of next year and it is hoped that students will have access to a fully-restored building from 2017 or 2018. Scroll down for video . The architects who will lead the painstaking restoration of the Glasgow School of Art's Mackintosh Building have been announced . The century-old library at the Glasgow School of Art designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh was gutted in May last year . Glasgow-based Page\\Park Architects have been chosen from a shortlist of five firms who bid for the role earlier this month . Professor Tom Inns, Director of The Glasgow School of Art, said the firm was chosen because of its work on Mackintosh-designed buildings . Professor Tom Inns, Director of The Glasgow School of Art, said: 'This is the beginning of an exciting journey of discovery. There will be many fascinating questions to be addressed as we undertake this complex restoration project. 'The team assembled by Page\\Park Architects impressed us not only with their deep knowledge of the building, but of the wider work of Charles Rennie Mackintosh. 'They also bring an understanding of the building's particular importance to Glasgow – its people and history - as well as of its status as an international design icon.' He added the firm has ongoing relationships with key crafts specialists and artists in Scotland and wider afield, and 'presented exciting proposals for expanding the legacy of the restoration by working with a new generation of creative talent'. Prof Toms added: 'We are looking forward to working in partnership with Page\\Park Architects and the design team to explore how we can best meet the needs of the GSA in the 21st century whilst remaining true to Mackintosh's astonishing vision.' The blaze began on May 23 last year after flammable spray foam for a student artwork was sucked into projector fan and caught alight . The fire started in the basement, where undergraduate students were putting the finishing touches to their final year art show . Firefighters in breathing apparatus stood shoulder to shoulder to forming a human line between the inferno and the unaffected sections . Thousands of damaged pieces of building material have been marked in the hope that experts can put them back where they were before . David Page, Head of Architecture at Page\\Park Architects, said: 'Page\\Park Architects are delighted to have won the commission to lead a team to restore the world-renowned Charles Rennie Mackintosh Glasgow School of Art. 'We have, over many years, had the privilege to work on and in the context of the Mackintosh legacy, the highlight of which will now be the opportunity to bring The Glasgow School of Art into splendid re-use for its students and staff, the people of Glasgow and the huge audience beyond the city.' The company has worked across the spectrum of Mackintosh's designs from the domestic, including the School of Art itself and the former Glasgow Herald offices, which is now The Lighthouse. The Mackintosh Building was damaged last year after a blaze sparked when canned spray foam, which a student was using for an art project, drifted into a projector fan and caught alight. The building caught fire on May 23, starting in the basement, where undergraduate students were putting the finishing touches to their final year art show. Blackened stones from the library's walls have been numbered with chalk. The building is considered by critics as Mackintosh's finest work . Firefighters were able to save irreplaceable paintings and furniture by Mackintosh after curators showed them pictures and and told them where they could be found . A student had been using highly flammable canned spray foam to fill in the gaps in a piece which involved three large sheets of thick foam, which formed three 'walls' framing a fourth blank wall, onto which a digital projector was beaming images when the spraying took place. As the fumes from the spray foam spread around the room, they were sucked into the cooling fan of the projector and caught alight as they wafted over the heat of the circuit board. The fire engulfed the basement room and spread to destroy much of the iconic building's west wing. Witnesses described firefighters in breathing apparatus standing shoulder to shoulder, forming a human line between the inferno and the unaffected sections of the art school in a bid to prevent the blaze from spreading. Other firefighters then darted in and out of the building to remove irreplaceable paintings and furniture by Mackintosh after curators showed them pictures and and told them where they could be found. Despite being insured for £50million, art school chiefs will receive much less because the east wing was almost completely untouched . The art school is continuing its efforts to raise £20million to pay for the restoration of the building and its fire-damaged contents . No one was injured in the fire, but there was extensive damage to the Grade A-listed library, the equivalent of Grade I listed in England . No one was injured in the fire, but there was extensive damage to the Grade A-listed library, the equivalent of Grade I listed in England, which was described by critics as Glasgow-born architect Mackintosh's greatest work. Thousands of damaged pieces of building material, including blackened stones from the library walls, have been removed and numbered with chalk in the hope that experts can put them back exactly where they were before. After a six-month investigation, the incident was described as a tragic accident by the art school's leaders. Despite being insured for £50million, art school chiefs will receive nowhere near that amount, because the east wing was almost completely untouched by the fire.

The 48-year-old ESPN analyst told GMA that the vile tweets about 17-year-old Gabby were 'a conscious decision to say evil stuff'. The baseball legend had shared a proud tweet last week about his only daughter joining as a pitcher for Salve Regina University's softball team - but it was met with crude, sexual remarks.

However a still-active Tumblr account belonging to Nagel revealed a stream of graphic sexual photos, pictures of marijuana and racist images. The second troll that Schilling named is Sean MacDonald, a part-time, ticket-seller for the New York Yankees and former vice president of the Theta Xi fraternity at Montclair State University, who recently graduated from the school. He was fired from his job with the Yankees, which he held since January, according to NJ.com.

Nagel also shared these images on his Tumblr account - but had vanished online on Tuesday after it was revealed he had been trolling a 17-year-old girl . Schilling wrote a blog post commenting on the astounding ignorance and lack of morals following the incident, and also shared the vile tweets by the trolls. He said on Tuesday: 'I'll do everything not to embarrass her but I'll never not protect her.' His daughter Gabby, who appeared with her father in the interview, added: 'No one should be able to get away with saying those things to a father about his daughter.' In what was meant to be an incredibly proud day for the family, quickly went sour on February 25 with vile responses to the baseball legend's original tweet. Schilling wrote on his blog post: 'And tweets with the word rape, bloody underwear and pretty much every other vulgar and defiling word you could likely fathom began to follow.' Mr Schilling told GMA on Tuesday: 'Anybody that reads those tweets and says it's just a joke, they are not fathers of kids.' He continued: 'I grew up in a locker room and never in my life have I uttered the words these guys were using.' MacDonald who went by Twitter handle @primetime227 along with Nagel, user @Nagels_Bagels, were among those who shared offensive tweets. Both of their social media accounts have since been deleted (above Schilling names MacDonald and Nagel in his 38 Pitches blog post) Father-of-four Schilling (pictured with his daughter Gabby) told GMA on Tuesday: 'I'll do everything not to embarrass her but I'll never not protect her' Tweets initially came from some people wanting to date Gabby once she was on campus, but soon turned offensive with many sexually-crude comments about the 17-year-old's body. MacDonald, who went by Twitter handle @primetime227, along with Nagel, user @Nagels_Bagels, were among those who shared offensive tweets. Both of their social media accounts have since been deleted. Brookdale Community College released a statement giving their sincerest apologies to Gabby and said the Twitter comments posted by the student were unacceptable. The school, said: '[The Twitter comments] clearly violate the standards of conduct that are expected of all Brookdale students. 'The student has been summarily suspended and will be scheduled for a conduct hearing where further disciplinary action will be taken. The Brookdale Police are actively investigating this matter.' Schilling said that once the tweets started being posted, Gabby came to him 'beyond upset' after she started to receive personal messages from guys.

'I know every one of their names, their parents, where they go to school, what they do, what team they are on, their positions, stats, all of it.' He said that the guys behind the bullying are not thugs or 'kids who had it rough', but they are 'pretty much' all white, affluent, college-attending children. Following the incident, he said a few of the other trolls wrote to him apologizing after they were suspended from their college sports' teams, and two others have since deleted their Twitter accounts. One Twitter user, Mike Kelly from Utah, wrote to Schilling asking if he felt good to have gotten kids 'kicked off' their sports teams. Schilling responded: 'Not sure I can tell you how good. Being able to defend my daughter. Someday when you understand honor, integrity, you'll get it.' In his protective-father mode, he also wrote as a reminder to those who went after his daughter that 'the real world has consequences' and that 'we're at a point now where you better be sure who you're going after'. At the end of his post he said that he apologized to Gabby, who he said might be embarrassed by it all, but  like any dad, he just wants her to head to college knowing how much he loves her.

Manchester United legend Scholes has accused the £42.5million man of ‘going through the motions’ during his time with the Gunners in comments made to a national newspaper. But the Arsenal manager has defended his record signing, saying: ‘It’s a wrong statement. He works very hard and he’s a great player. A player like Paul Scholes would have loved to play with Ozil. Mesut has a point to prove and he knows that. Paul Scholes hit out at German playmaker Mesut Ozil by insisting he took easy option when he joined Arsenal . Arsenal ace Ozil has scored four goals during the course of the current campaign . Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has leaped to Ozil's defence by hitting back at former United ace Scholes . ‘I believe he has the quality, he puts a lot of effort in to help the team and he works much harder than his style shows. ‘You can be cheated a little bit by his style of play, because he is fluid, easy, subtle and he does not look like he puts the effort in, but he does.’ Meanwhile, Wenger has launched a staunch defence of summer signing Danny Welbeck as the forward prepares for his Manchester United return. After arriving at the Emirates Stadium intent on playing as a central striker, the England international has found himself playing out wide again, a position he found frustrating during his time at Old Trafford. He has scored seven goals since arriving from United in August — three of those coming in a Champions League win over Galatasaray. But ahead of Monday’s FA Cup quarter-final, Wenger insists Welbeck has not been a £16million flop. Wenger and Ozil in training at London Colney ahead of their FA Cup clash against Manchester United . Ozil has divided opinion among Arsenal fans and the wider public since arriving in England . Wenger also defended former Manchester United striker Danny Welbeck's impact at Arsenal . ‘He’s very important and has played many games since the start of the season,’ said Wenger — who confirmed central defender Gabriel will miss up to three weeks with a hamstring injury. ‘If you check the statistics you will see (the suggestion Welbeck doesn’t play often) is wrong. He’s one of the players who has played the most games for us, but not in the last couple of games. Wenger also spoke to Sportsmail’s Martin Keown in an interview for the BBC’s Football Focus, to be broadcast on Saturday. In it, the Arsenal manager, who has won the FA Cup five times, discussed his favourite memories of the competition and which of the wins meant most to him. Wenger said: ‘Maybe the first one against Newcastle was the best because it was when we won the double in 1998. I remember absolutely everything about that day because it was at Wembley. When I was a kid in France I saw the cup finals. For me to come from a little village and go for the first time to Wembley was something special. It was a great old stadium, the soul was there, the grass was special.’ Scholes believes the likes of Manchester United's Robin van Persie left Arsenal because they were ambitious . The likes of Cesc Fabregas and Thierry Henry also left Arsenal to add to their personal trophy collection . But when asked about his collection of medals, Wenger admitted he cared little for them. He said: ‘I don’t even know where they are. Maybe I will regret it. I would like to think I get more out of the human side of my career. ‘I prefer to have a box of memories than a box of medals. What is interesting is that you can have an influence on people’s lives. They can have a big influence on you as well.’ Arsenal face United on Monday and Wenger enjoyed many classic cup ties against Sir Alex Ferguson’s side, but he said the pair’s frosty relationship had thawed in recent years. ‘I am happy to see him now,’ said Wenger, ‘more than before because we have gone through some different periods. In the end it became more respectful and of course he was not always objective in defending his team. Nor was I! That created disagreements. ‘Now we are happy to have dinner together and a good glass of wine and rise above the differences.’ But Monday’s tie doesn’t please him. ‘I wanted to play at home. But fantastic game or not, what is important is that you go through. It would have been better at home. Now it is what it is, you want to qualify for the semi-final.’"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has hit back at ex-United ace Paul Scholes .\nScholes claimed Mesut Ozil took easy option to join Arsenal from Real .\nArsenal signed Ozil from Real Madrid for £42.4m in September 2013 .\nGilberto Silva: Ozil is too slow and he needs to be more decisive .\nREAD: Ozil has more assists since joining Arsenal than any Premier League player... except for Chelsea star Cesc Fabregas .\nCLICK HERE for all the latest Arsenal news ."}]}

But tiny songbird the blackpoll warbler routinely undertakes non-stop flights of up to 1,700 miles across open ocean, scientists have confirmed. The heroic journeys are 'on the brink of impossibility', according to one of the researchers who attached tracking devices to 40 birds. Long journey: The blackpoll warbler routinely undertakes flights of up to 1,700 miles, flying without stopping to rest, eat or drink across the Atlantic . Experts had long wondered about tantalising clues that suggested the warbler was capable of epic migrations between North and South America. Now they have proof that it really does fly without stopping to rest, eat or drink across the Atlantic. Unlike other migratory songbirds travelling south for the winter, the warbler ignores the safe option of hugging the coastline through Mexico and Central America. Instead it risks death by flying hundreds of miles from land even though it cannot land on water and live. Nice flight: A blackpoll warbler wearing a miniature tracking device . US scientists were astonished when they analysed data from some of the birds they tracked from New England and Canada to the Caribbean, Venezuela and Colombia. Dr Bill DeLuca, from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, said: 'It was pretty thrilling to get the return birds back, because their migratory feat in itself is on the brink of impossibility. 'When we accessed the locators, we saw the blackpolls' journey was indeed directly over the Atlantic. The distances travelled ranged from 1,410 to 1,721 miles.' He added: 'For small songbirds, we are only just now beginning to understand the migratory routes that connect temperate breeding grounds to tropical wintering areas. 'We're really excited to report that this is one of the longest non-stop over-water flights ever recorded for a songbird, and finally confirms what has long been believed to be one of the most extraordinary migratory feats on the planet.' For the study, published in the Royal Society journal Biology Letters, the scientists captured 20 birds in Vermont and another 20 in Nova Scotia and fitted them with geolocator packs. The devices, each about the size of a 5p piece, were attached using leg harnesses, much like a rucksack. Too small to house GPS receivers, they operated by means of 'solar geolocation' - a method used for centuries by mariners and explorers. It is based on the fact that day length varies with latitude and the time of solar noon - when the sun is at its highest point in the sky - varies with longitude."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Blackpoll warbler undertakes non-stop flights of up to 1,700 miles .\nFlies without stopping to rest, eat or drink across the Atlantic .\nUS scientists tracked birds from New England to the Caribbean ."}]}

The Des Moines Register reports that while Young did know she was pregnant, she did not know just how far along she was with her new baby, thinking she was only 12 weeks along at the time. As for the speedy labor, that is likely due to the fact that Young has had three other labors in just the past few years. 'I've been in shock for the last couple of days, because I didn't expect a full-term baby,' Young said. 'With my other kids, I had like three or four pushes. And with her it was just one and she was there.' Little Miracle meanwhile could not have done better in the situation. 'This baby's eyes were open; she was just sitting there staring at me.

Woods is taking an indefinite break from golf as he attempts to get his game 'tournament ready' after a poor run of form and injuries. Former Tour player Dan Olsen, who played in 35 Tour events between 1989 and 2011 - missing 22 cuts - alleged in an interview on US radio station 730AM The Game on Friday that Woods was serving a drugs ban, but on Monday retracted his claims and issued an apology to the 14-time major winner. Dan Olsen had alleged in a radio interview that Tiger Woods (pictured) was serving a one month suspension . Olsen has since apologised to Woods and to the PGA Tour for the comments he made . 'I retract the entire interview,' Olsen said in a statement on the radio station's website. 'My comments were ill-advised. I want to apologise to Nike, the PGA Tour, Phil Mickelson, Tiger Woods and (Tour commissioner) Tim Finchem.' The allegations had brought a strong denial from the PGA, with PGA Tour executive vice-president and chief marketing officer Ty Votaw issuing a statement. 'There is no truth whatsoever to these claims,' it read. 'We categorically deny these allegations.' Woods' agent Mark Steinberg also quashed the allegations, labelling them 'unequivocally and completely false'. 14-time major championship winner Woods, pictured here in June 2013 at Merion Golf Club, hopes to reclaim his world No 1 status from Rory McIlory when he returns to the sport .

Having just cruised beyond their nearest challengers, Celtic promptly ran into a roadblock. It was built by a deeply determined St Johnstone side seemingly inspired by a return to the scene of the greatest day in the club’s history. Danny Swanson wasn’t on the books when they lifted last season’s Scottish Cup, yet his winning strike here was worthy of its own place in the memory banks of every Saints fan. With that pure, powerful swipe of his right boot, Swanson not only lifted his team into the Premiership top six, but kept Celtic within six points of Aberdeen. A run of ten successive domestic victories – a sequence which had granted Ronny Deila a new level of acclaim from Parkhead supporters – was brought to a shuddering halt. St Johnstone's Danny Swanson marked first Scottish Premiership start with a glorious first-time effort . Bookmakers will hardly be hiking their odds on them ending up with a four successive league crown. That much can still be viewed as a racing certainty. Here, though, was evidence that the odd chicane may still have to be negotiated en route. By the next time Celtic play in the top-flight – at Dens Park on March 18 – they will have come through Scottish Cup last eight and League Cup final meetings against Dundee United. Their Treble ambitions will be much clearer after that double-header, but any repeat of the wayward sluggishness shown last night will place the much-desired clean sweep in peril. To focus only on the failings of the Parkhead side would, however, be a gross injustice to St Johnstone. Not for the first time in his tenure, manager Tommy Wright produced the ideal tactical plan for his charges to follow. Celtic's Leigh Griffiths can't hide his disappointment after the defeat by St Johnstone . They had numerous fine performers and defended doggedly, occasionally desperately, throughout. But it wasn’t only Swanson who brought a touch of class. In David Wotherspoon, who operated just off central striker Steven MacLean, they had the most impressive overall contributor on show. Now two points ahead of Dundee, Wright’s men look well set for a fourth consecutive top-half finish. The Parkhead pitch is far from pristine as spring approaches but that couldn’t entirely account for the sloppiness Celtic showed in the first half. Compared with some of their recent showings, this was turgid stuff at times. As expected, they still dominated both possession and chances, yet Alan Mannus wasn’t exactly in need of a lie down at the interval. Anthony Stokes – making his first appearance since being late back from Dublin prior to the first leg against Inter Milan – offered the first flicker of threat with an angled shot whipped across the face of goal. Perhaps the most fluid move of the opening period then led to Gary Mackay-Steven striking a wicked curler first-time. Mannus stretched high to thwart it before denying Stokes on the follow-up. Celtic manager Ronny Deila sits dejected in the dugout o Wednesday night . Leigh Griffiths was being rationed on opportunities at the apex of Deila’s side. He took matters into his own hands with a low, left-foot thump that zipped fractionally wide from almost 30 yards out. The striker then threatened to hare clear down the left when released by Craig Gordon’s quick throw, only to be halted by a Swanson foul straight from the ‘professional’ drawer. The Saints midfielder earned both a yellow card from referee Calum Murray and a jabbing finger of rebuke from Scott Brown. Nir Bitton had dropped to the bench after showing signs of tiredness against Aberdeen, which meant Stedan Johansen taking a step back to partner Brown in central midfield. It was far from a radical alteration but the pieces weren’t quite clicking into place. Stuart Armstrong looked as likely as any in Celtic colours before the break but his rising drive was beaten away by Mannus. St Johnstone were persistently stretched but kept going about their defending in an organised manner. There were, though, only the most fleeting signs of danger at the opposite end of the field. Danny Swanson (far right) celebrates with his team-mates after scoring against Celtic . Jason Denayer was forced to divert a Michael O’Halloran shot behind, before David Wotherspoon had their clearest opportunity of the half. After Efe Ambrose was hustled off the ball, Wotherspoon cut along the 18-yard line but failed to find the space on either side of Craig Gordon. Deila opted for a switch at half-time, introducing Wakaso Mubark for Adam Matthews. The attack-minded Ghanaian slotted in at left-back, with Ambrose shifted to the opposite flank. The move carried an element of risk, with Wakaso looking unsure defensively, but Celtic fell behind to a 53rd minute strike they could have do nothing about. Swanson watched Wotherspoon’s corner being headed out and stepped forward to connect with a quite brilliant half-volley that arrowed past Gordon from 25 yards. Expect it to feature on all forthcoming goal of the season showreels. Saints should have gone two in front in quick succession when another somehow found its way through to Steven Anderson. It was, though, a case of wrong man in the right place as the centre-back miscued wide from around eight yards. Celtic goalkeeper Craig Gordon attempts to catch the ball in the air under pressure . Deila had watched it all from the edge of his technical area with increasing concern. He played his final hand before the hour mark, withdrawing Mackay-Steven and Stokes for James Forrest and Bitton. That allowed Johansen to step forward into his more regular role and help bring about the inevitable rise in pressure. Mannus made a terrific stop to thwart an Ambrose headed from Johansen’s corner before then grasping a Bitton daisy-cutter at the second attempt. Another Amstrong shot was calmly clutched to his chest. The signal for only two minutes of added time brought loud jeers from the home support. Rightly, they suspected that last night was simply one of those occasions when their team would need a lot longer to find the net."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "On-loan Coventry midfielder Danny Swanson scored winner for Saints .\nSt Johnstone up to sixth and Aberdeen given fresh hope in title race .\nCeltic suffer shock defeat after 10 domestic victories in a row this year ."}]}

Robert Wright, 49, flew from Texas with his father to their former home in Fontana to pick up the 37-year-old time capsule that Wright once hid while his family was remodeling the house. Inside he placed a signed note, a few coins, a newspaper cutting and a McDonald's scratch card. Robert Wright (pictured left as a 12-year-old and right today) was reunited with a time capsule he hid inside the walls of his home in 1978 . The 12-year-old Wright explained in the note that his dad was redoing the wall's paneling, which gave him the chance to hide the note away. He also provided 'proof' of the date with a newspaper clipping . In the note, Wright wrote: 'Hello to whoever finds this. My name is Robert Wright. Today my dad is putting up paneling. Today is November 18th, 1978, 15 till 12:00 noon'. 'I'm 12 years old and a student at Fontana JR. High, 7th grade. I am 5'3, blond hair, hazel eyes.' 'Here is proof of the date. Robert Wright.' Wright told ABC News it was 'surreal' to be reunited with the capsule he never thought he'd seen again. The capsule was a 'spur-of-the-moment idea', according to Wright, who quickly gathered some trinkets from his room before his dad sealed the interior wall he was redoing. He tore off a newspaper and threw in the McDonald's ticket to prove the date. The capsule wasn't unearthed until six years ago when Greg Sandoval, the home's current owner, was doing a renovation of his own.

Mum-of-two Zoe Dronfield, 38, suffered a bleed on the brain and a neck wound after partner Jason Smith, 31, from Coventry, launched a ferocious eight-hour attack. When she regained consciousness, she found Smith slashing his wrists in a suicide bid but she had no memory of the assault. She feared he would escape justice until she hired a hypnotherapist who helped her piece together the details of the attack. Scroll down for video . Recovery: Zoe Dronfield hired a hypnotherapist who helped her piece together the details of the horrific attach . Injuries: Ms Dronfield suffered a bleed on the brain and a neck wound after partner Jason Smith, 31, from Coventry, launched a ferocious eight-hour attack . Police then used her evidence in court to convince a jury to convict him of assault occasioning grievous bodily harm with intent and criminal damage. Today, Ms Dronfield, from from Coventry, West Midlands watched Smith jailed for ten years at Warwick Crown Court in Leamington Spa. Recorder Richard Atkins QC told him: 'Having beaten her and knocked her senseless you then took a knife to her face. 'The photographs of the victim's injuries are deeply unpleasant. She was quite viciously assaulted and savagely cut. 'This was a sustained attack. There were numerous blows to the victim's head and body with feet and a sharp object. 'I've no doubt you've been a good father to your seven-year-old daughter and it saddens me she won't see you as a free man for some time . 'But there's a violent bully in you that won't take no for an answer. I therefore feel ten years in prison plus four on licence is an appropriate sentence.'

Lee Egan, defending, said: 'My client doesn't accept guilt. 'His overriding concern at the police interview immediately after the incident was for Ms Dronfield's welfare. It was an isolated incident and it was not premeditated. 'But she did suffer life changing injuries. He does feel remorse for causing them, although he doesn't remember doing it.' Ms Dronfield, from Coventry, was stabbed in the neck by Smith on February 2 last year. He then stamped on her head, leaving her with horrific injuries. She suffered a cracked cheekbone, a bleed on the brain and the stab wound was just 1cm from her jugular vein. The savage assault also left her with short term memory loss which meant she was unable to recall the hours before the attack. Ms Donfield suffered a cracked cheekbone, a bleed on the brain and the stab wound was just 1cm from her jugular vein . Both of her arms were cut in the attack. The savage assault also left Ms Dronfield with short term memory loss . Speaking after the case, she said: 'I think it was a fair outcome and justice has been done. 'It's about time courts started taking domestic violence seriously. Jason is a controlling bully and I think he has a personality disorder. 'I feel lucky to be alive and I'm glad he's been put away where he can't hurt any other women. 'After the attack I was a shell of my former self and I've never been so low in my life. 'Many women take their own lives after such events but I had to find a way to fight through it and that's why I wanted to get hypnotherapy - to build me back up mentally and fill in the blanks.' 'I want to show other women they can do the same, we do not have to let abusers win,' she added. Zoe met Smith on Facebook and they were in a relationship for a year before he attacked her. They had mutual friends on the social media site and they began chatting, before he soon began showering her with compliments and offering to take her out. It was only after Ms Donfield (right) visited David Kilmurry (left), a cognitive behavioral hypnotherapist, that she was able to remember the attack that changed her life . Mr Kilmurry said: 'I have worked with Zoe and I am proud to have helped her to retrieve her memory and rebuild her confidence following the trauma' Smith acted like a true gentleman, taking to her expensive restaurants and hotels, and treating her like a princess. They had spent the night of the attack talking before Smith fell asleep and Ms Dronfield went to bed. She said: 'The next thing I knew, I woke up covered in blood and had no idea what was happening. 'My first thought was I wasn't going to die because I needed to be there for my children. I grew up without a mother and I didn't want that for my children. 'The whole house was covered in blood. The bedroom was red and the bed was sodden. It was like a scene from a horror film. 'The bath was filled with water and he was cleaning knives in the bath. There was an eight-inch knife and a meat cleaver.' Just a week before the attack, Ms Dronfield was forced to hide in her wardrobe when Smith stormed into her home after she tried to end their relationship. Prosecutor Raj Punia said: 'A week previously he had come into her home unannounced while she was alone with her four-year-old daughter. 'He damaged a door and ran upstairs where the victim was hiding in a wardrobe in her bedroom. He demanded to know why she wouldn't speak to him anymore.'

He said: 'Zoe has made a truly amazing recovery from devastating physical and psychological injuries, to go to court and give evidence. 'I have worked with Zoe and I am proud to have helped her to retrieve her memory and rebuild her confidence following the trauma. 'I feel that her development has been quite amazing.

The 28-year-old will take to the ring against Romanian Jo Jo Dan less than six months after a horrific machete attack in Tenerife which left him fighting for his life with blood pouring from a 12-inch wound. And having fought his way up through the city's sports halls and leisure centres to finally top the bill in front of an expected crowd of more than 10,000, Brook admitted his biggest battle might be to stop his emotions getting the better of him. Kell Brook poses on the scales at the weigh in ahead of his match with title challenger Jo Jo Dan . Brook will defend his IBF welterweight title against Dan in his home city of Sheffield on Saturday night . Brook is set to compete less than six months after a horrific stab attack nearly left him dead in Tenerife . Dan poses on the scales at the weigh in ahead of his title match with IBF welterweight champion Brook . Brook's attack left him with a 12-inch wound on his thigh and he has shown great strength to recover . Brook said: 'When I was laid in hospital with my leg tied up it felt like I was at the bottom of my ocean and I remember when it first happened my whole life flashed before my eyes. 'I thought, 'this is game over for me now', but I remember getting to the hospital and being wheeled out and feeling the fresh air and seeing the birds flying about and thinking 'I'm here, I'm alive'. 'I think when you've been that close to death it definitely changes you. 'It is going to be hard going from the leisure centres to packing out the Arena, but I was born to do this and I believe I perform better under pressure. 'It took me a long time to get this belt and with what I've had to go through there is no way on this earth Jo Jo Dan is taking it off me. I've kept everyone waiting and they are in for a real treat.' Brook took the title from previous holder Shawn Porter in California in August and knows victory over Dan could pave the way to much more lucrative bouts in the 147lbs division. While his stated aim of sealing a showdown with the winner of the May super-fight between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao may be over-ambitious, plenty of other potential money-spinning bouts remain. Brook claimed the IBF welterweight title in 2014 when he defeated the previous holder Shawn Porter (left) Brook and Dan square up with one another ahead of their IBF title match in Sheffield on Saturday . Brook has also expressed an interest in facing Floyd Mayweather or Manny Pacquiao in the near future . And while Brook is right not to under-estimate his Canada-based opponent, it is hard to see how the 33-year-old Dan is likely to pose much of a threat. His record is a solid enough 34-2 with 18 stoppage wins, but his two losses came on his only two previous forays anywhere near top class, both against Turkish opponent Selcuk Aydin in 2010 and 2011. Brook added: 'You can never look past any opponent and you never know what is going to happen - you have to take every fight and every day at a time. 'If you are asking me if I want to fight Mayweather or Pacquiao, of course I do. I'm the world champion and I'm leading the way and I've got to look for the higher profile fights.

Army National Guard Sgt First Class Joseph Kern flew home to Cherry Hill, New Jersey during his fifth deployment on Thursday and will be with his family for five days. His first stop after he touched down on American soil was his two-year-old daughter Pearl's classroom, where he had the chance to surprise her and his other daughter, three-year-old Estelle. Scroll down for video . Army National Guard Sgt First Class Joseph Kern flew home from his deployment in Qatar to surprise his two daughters, Estelle, three, and Pearl, two . He surprised the girls in Pearl's  (front) classroom on her second birthday on Thursday. He'll be home for five days . Kern's wife, Sarah Woldoff, a neuro-psychologist in Princeton, said that the military no longer offers leave, so the couple had to pay out of pocket for him to come home, according to ABC. He left for Qatar in June and had already missed Estelle's birthday, so Woldoff said her husband's plane ticket was 'worth every dollar'. She added that seeing Kern reunite with their daughters was 'breathtaking'. Estelle was 'a little bit confused and in shock' when she saw her dad, according to Woldoff. Kern and his wife Sarah Woldoff (left, holding Estelle) said that Pearl didn't immediately recognize him, but Woldoff said the reunion was still 'breathtaking' Woldoff said that the couple was 'disappointed' with Pearl's response, but they hope having the video will help her remember the reunion when she gets older . Unfortunately, Pearl didn't seem to recognize her dad when he walked in, and instead when to hug her grandpa. 'We were both slightly disappointed with Pearl's response,' Woldoff told ABC. 'You never realize that they're so young, they don't have as much memory of him as we anticipated.' But the mom-of-two hopes that having the reunion on video will help her daughter remember it when she get older. 'In hindsight, I'm really glad we did it the way we did. Pearl's too little to have the memory of it, but I think Estelle will remember,' she said. 'And it'll ease the transition. Everyone forgets he has to go back on Tuesday, and it's really confusing for her on why he has to leave again.' Woldoff said that the National Guard does not give leave anymore, so the couple paid out of pocket for Kern's visit . Kern missed Estelle's (right) birthday while he was away, so this trip was 'worth every dollar', according to Woldoff . His daughters weren't the only ones he had the chance to surprise during his time home, however. Kern surprised his mom at a restaurant by dressing up like a waiter and walking around the dining room as she ate. 'My mother-in-law didn't even realize it was him. We had to point it out,' Woldoff said. 'She lost it. She was in utter shock and just hysterical.' Kern will likely be in Qatar until June, making it a year-long deployment, according to NorthJersey.com.

There have been times over the last 12 months, particularly at the World Cup, when I wondered whether we had seen the best of him but what he did against Manchester City was magnificent proof that he is still the best around. What he did to City — and the way he has played since Christmas — makes me think he has jumped back above Cristiano Ronaldo in their struggle to be football’s No 1. It will make their battle in this weekend’s Clasico even more intriguing. Lionel Messi was in inspired form against Manchester City and proved he is still the best around . Cristiano Ronaldo has struggled of late and Messi may have jumped back above the Real Madrid star .

He gave us a couple of moments of his time and, inevitably, Guardiola was asked whether he fancied coming up against Messi when the quarter-final draw was made. Bayern, after all, have been in outstanding form, scoring goals for fun, but his reaction was telling. ‘No! No! No!’ said Guardiola. ‘If I have to face Messi, I want it to be in one game rather than two!’ If they do happen to face each other in Berlin — and after Friday's draw it is not wrong to expect Barcelona and Bayern Munich to reach the semi-finals at least — we could safely say we will be in for a rare treat.

(Constable £20) At the start of the Falklands War in 1982, William Waldegrave, then a junior minister in Margaret Thatcher’s government, was standing in the division lobby of the House of Commons when he saw Thatcher and her entourage of ‘toadies’ marching towards him. He felt compelled to say something, so, with the U.S. Secretary of State Alexander Haig at the time trying to broker a British ‘sell-out’ to the Argentinians, he asked: ‘Where do the Americans stand, Prime Minister?’ ‘I don’t know, William,’ came the immediate reply. ‘But I know where they are going to stand.’ Would that David Cameron could deal so unequivocally with the White House, but then none of Thatcher’s successors have, least of all the pusillanimous Tony Blair, whom Waldegrave compares with Ted Heath. Margaret Thatcher (right) is once said to have fought off Norman Tebbit (left) with a snarling remark in Waldegrave's defence . This is surprising, for Waldegrave was a passionate Heath loyalist before transferring his allegiance to Thatcher. But he is surely right when he asserts that Heath’s great disappointment in life was that the patriotic, liberal Conservative Party in which he believed so fervently — ‘he and it were family’ — did not return his devotion. And in that respect Waldegrave is reminded of Blair, who ‘genuinely thought — and thinks — that he created a family called New Labour which loved him’. In fact it was success that New Labour loved, not Blair. This absorbing memoir contains some choice gossip as a counter-balance to Waldegrave’s insightful political analysis. Getting back to Heath, he recalls one of the old curmudgeon’s dinner parties — ‘not occasions of much merriment’ — at which Emma Soames gamely tried to enliven proceedings with an anecdote about her brother Nicholas, who had just been selected to contest a tough seat in Glasgow. At a raucous selection meeting, very unlike anything in the Home Counties, the prospective MP had been grasped by the lapels and asked, ‘Are ye married?’ Around Heath’s table, the diners waited expectantly for the end of an amusing story, but Soames suddenly and mystifyingly stopped speaking. Driving her home later, Waldegrave asked if she’d forgotten the punchline? ‘No,’ she said. ‘I was on autopilot and got that far without remembering that after Nicholas admitted to being unmarried, the response was: “Och, not another Tory poofter!” ’ She hadn’t wanted to offend her illustrious host, whose sexuality was always the subject of speculation — though Waldegrave adds that in relation to the Scotsman’s allegation, it was not ‘as far as anyone I ever knew could discover, true’. Waldegrave’s own background differs markedly from those of two of his Tory heroes, Heath and Thatcher, if rather less from that of another, the grouse-shooting enthusiast Harold Macmillan, whom he recalls silencing another dinner party, this time at Waldegrave’s own house, by turning to his neighbour and declaring: ‘Such a pity they abolished the gold sovereign, you know. What does one tip one’s loader?’ Waldegrave's privileged background was very different to that of his Tory hero, Margaret Thatcher (pictured) The seventh and youngest child of an earl, directly descended from King James II, Waldegrave is himself the very definition of a toff. And he grew up privileged not just socially and materially but also intellectually. His parents’ friends included the philosopher Isaiah Berlin. He was educated at Eton, Oxford and Harvard. His accent alone opened doors, as he made his way in the world in the Sixties. As a scruffy, long-haired student, he once tried to check in for the night at the Great Western Hotel at Paddington, admitting that he had no money on him but would pay once they sent him the bill. The cut-glass vowels, and his explanation that there had once been a locomotive on the Great Western line named after his family — The Earl Waldegrave — secured him the room. For those of us who do not come from such lofty beginnings, there is something beguiling yet also appalling about the upper-class milieu Waldegrave describes so well. After his engagement to Victoria Rothschild ended — her father, the political power-broker Victor Rothschild, had made a protégé of him — he found a letter to his own father from a fellow Wykehamist, stating: ‘You must be pleased to see the back of the Jewess.’ From an early age, Waldegrave’s ambition was to rise to high political office. The path ahead looked gilded when he became MP for Bristol West in 1979, and Thatcher did eventually make him Health Secretary. She liked and rated him, and once fought off a snarling Norman Tebbit on his behalf. From an early age, Waldegrave's ambition was to rise to high political office, Thatcher (pictured) liked him and eventually made him Health Secretary . As Britain’s representative on the European Environment Council in 1984, Waldegrave had tried to force British Leyland into taking the dangers of pollution more seriously. This enraged Tebbit, who savaged him during a meeting at No 10 for being a toff, and knowing nothing of the concerns of working folk at British Leyland. Thatcher listened, and then ‘began to purr dangerously’. With magnificent condescension, she explained to Tebbit that she was a chemist, and that it was he, not Waldegrave, who did not understand these matters. Bit by bit, she dismantled Tebbit’s case until he had no argument left. ‘I said absolutely nothing,’ Waldegrave writes. ‘I just sat there, terrified, while these great animals fought over me. ‘As we all filed out, she grasped my elbow, quite hard, and said: “I always look after my young people, William.” ’ But Thatcher’s patronage wasn’t enough. Gradually it occurred, if at first only to him, that he would never reach the top of the greasy pole. He was instinctively a loyalist, and didn’t always back the right horse. Yet this elegantly-written volume is not really an exercise in score-settling, as so many political memoirs are. It is more a reflection on a fascinating life than an account of it, and Waldegrave is an astute observer of the political animal, noting that the current Mayor of London has more than a little in common with the late Willie Whitelaw. ‘A subtle and intelligent man, he knew that the British do not like their politicians to appear too clever,’ he writes of Whitelaw. ‘His deliberate comical obfuscations predated Boris Johnson’s by 30 years, and were a delight.’ On the whole, Waldegrave wears his social pedigree about as lightly as he can, while exploiting it to shed light, sometimes alarmingly, but also hilariously, on upper-crust ways. While holidaying with the Rothschilds in Barbados, he visited rich socialites Ronnie and Marietta Tree, who ‘along with their supermodel daughter Penelope (who could water-ski on bare feet) occupied the classical house at Heron’s Bay. ‘There Tull the butler was alleged once to have silenced a boring guest at Rothschild’s request by means of powdered Nembutal in his bullshot’. Many people emerge heroically from Waldegrave’s engrossing reminiscences — not least the great love of his life, his cookery teacher wife Caroline — but possibly none more so than Tull the butler."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Waldegrave grew up privileged not just socially but intellectually .\nHe was a Heath loyalist before transferring to his loyalties to Thatcher .\nFrom an early age, his ambition was to rise to high political office .\nThatcher liked him and eventually made him Health Secretary ."}]}

Iraqi forces steadily bombarded the last part of Tikrit still controlled by ISIS, with fighting described by one wounded man as intense. Still, even as it fends off this assault, the militant group continues with its barbaric tactics. \"Yesterday, bodies floated down the (Tigris) River from the hospital,\" said Saber Kraidi, an eight-year Iraqi military veteran. \"They were people from Tikrit executed by ISIS.\" The Iraqi military is joined by some Sunni fighters and a predominantly Shiite militia, working together to retake the city best known to most Westerners as the hometown of former dictator Saddam Hussein. They are working on not just winning the battle, but securing the peace.  Members of the Badr organization, a powerful Shiite armed group, handed out food and supplies Friday to residents of the Sunni village of Albu Safah, whose 30 families have been holed up the last 10 months amid the fighting. The village's leader, Haji Jamid, said the Shiite fighters' efforts were working. \"They're good,\" Jamid said. \"If someone is sick, they'll take them to the doctor, even at 2 or 3 in the morning. \"If it weren't for them, ISIS would have slaughtered us.\" In June, Tikrit fell to ISIS, which has conquered large areas of Iraq and Syria and claimed them as part of its Islamic caliphate. There have several attempts to take it back since then, all of them failures. The latest push began this month, involving around 30,000 fighters. By Thursday, the government controlled about 75% of the besieged city, with about 150 holdout ISIS fighters controlling the rest, said Main Al-Kadhimi, commander of the Hashd Al-Shaabi militia. There was no independent confirmation of such a significant advance by the Iraqi forces. But they have been making progress in recent days. That includes gaining control of Tikrit Military Hospital, a few blocks south of the presidential palace, on Wednesday. The goal is that, if Iraqi and allied forces can take Tikrit, then they'll have more realistic hope of similarly winning back Mosul -- a city that's nearly 10 times bigger. Yet, even if ISIS is losing ground in Tikrit, that doesn't mean it's not a dangerous, destructive force elsewhere. Case in point is happening about 100 miles south of Tikrit in Ramadi, which the extremist group began assaulting on Wednesday. Faleh al-Issawi, deputy head of the Anbar provincial council, has said officials believe the Ramadi assault \"is an ISIS response to the Tikrit operation.\" More than 40 Iraqi soldiers died when ISIS blew up the Iraqi army headquarters near Ramadi in Iraq's western Anbar province, an Anbar provincial leader told CNN on Friday. ISIS fighters there dug a tunnel underneath the army headquarters and detonated hundreds of homemade bombs, Sabah Al-Karhout, the head of the Anbar Provincial Council, said Thursday. The headquarters are located in the Albu Diab area, just 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) north of Ramadi. Al-Karhout denied reports that the U.S.-led coalition had bombed the headquarters. So, too, did the U.S. government, with its Baghdad embassy stating Friday that no coalition aircraft were even in the area . A statement released early Friday by the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS said the Iraqi security forces had successfully repelled the ISIS attack on Ramadi, despite coming under attack from several directions. \"The successful defense of Ramadi by Iraqi Security Forces is another example of their increasing ability to defeat Daesh in multiple locations and prevent the terrorist group from gaining ground,\" said Lt. Gen. James L. Terry, the coalition force's commander, using another name for ISIS. \"The ISF continues to hold terrain in some locations while making gains in others.\" In an audio message posted Thursday, ISIS spokesman  Abu Mohammed al Adnani called reports of victories by coalition members against the extremist group \"delusional and fake.\" He spoke of the coalition's use of fighter jets, heavy artillery and tanks, saying it is a \"nightmare and will go eventually.\" CNN's Ben Wedeman reported near Tikrit in Iraq.

In the last year alone the MoD paid out £13.5million in compensation to civilian staff – which amounts to almost a third of the £45million given to serving soldiers. It means that for every £3,000 paid  to injured soldiers the government handed £1,000 to MoD bureaucrats for office falls, according to the figures released under freedom of information rules. While soldiers in Afghanistan have risked their lives fighting the Taliban, MoD staff stationed in the UK are constantly being carted off to hospital for trips, falls, crashes and bizarre health and safety incidents. Soldiers, pictured attending the annual Irish Guards St Patrick's Day Parade in Aldershot this week, have received £45million in compensation last year - but another £13.5million was paid to bureaucrats . The details of the catalogue of mishaps to befall military personnel in the UK were revealed by safety officers who have had to record all serious incidents for the Health and Safety Executive. Although there were parachuting, roping and other training course injuries sustained by military personnel last year there were also a host of more mundane office based accidents. In one, a man rushed back into his office to answer the phone on his desk only to trip over a hidden vacuum cleaner. The person smashed into a rubbish bin and their office chair and needed a week off work to recover from the injuries. Another person was walking out of a meeting when they were distracted by a colleague and ended up walking into a wall and breaking their wrist. One person hurt their back when the legs on the right side of their chair snapped off sending the person toppling onto the floor. In a similar incident a roller came off one of the legs of a moveable office chair sending the person who was sitting in it crashing to the floor. A member of the public who was visiting a recreation of a World War I trench ended up in hospital with a gash to their head when they stood on a crate to get a view over the top and toppled back over. In a separate case a group of cadets were injured when the camping gas canister they were using to cook a meal exploded, leaving one girl with bad burns. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon was last year forced to pay out more than £1million a month in compensation claims for bureaucrats injured at work, new figures reveal . Another MOD worker was off work for more than a month after they injured their bladder in a slip on the newly cleaned floor of the office toilets, while a dog handler suffered bad cuts after trying to separate a fight between two military dogs. All the incidents were recorded on RIDDOR forms which the Health and Safety Executive make organisations fill out when there has been a serious injury in the workplace or a dangerous incident that could have led to an accident. An MOD spokesperson said: 'MOD has a duty of care to all its employees whether military or civilian personnel. 'Claims brought for civil damages are considered on the basis of complex legal liability and where liability is proved compensation is paid but we robustly resist spurious claims. 'The amount of compensation is determined by common law principles and payments are often made to those who have suffered the most severe injuries in the course of their work.'"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the last year the MoD paid out £13.5m in compensation to civilian staff .\nServing soldiers injured serving their country meanwhile received £45m .\nFor every £3,000 paid to injured soldiers, £1,000 is handed to civil servants ."}]}

Police chiefs today announced that they have arrested 56 people - all Brits, including the three alleged leaders - and uncovered 500 mostly pensioner victims. And they said they feared thousands more would now be identified following a series of Costa del Sol raids against the gang which had been operating for more than five years. Detectives detailed the lengths the fraudsters went to dupe victims into handing over cash at a press conference in Malaga this morning. The three-tier scam involved calls from fake lawyers and court officials who persuaded their victims to hand over up to £35,000 after being conned into selling their timeshares. Scroll down for video . Hotspot: The alleged ringleaders, who have not been named, are suspected of laundering the multi-million pound proceeds of their fraud through bars and restaurants on the Costa del Sol (pictured) The chief alleged ringleader, a Brit living in the resort of Mijas, had three homes and a boat and drove two luxury cars he is thought to have bought with his ill-gotten gains. Nearly 80 bank accounts linked to the gang have been frozen and six vehicles seized along with the boat and properties valued at nearly £600,000. Lead investigator, Inspector Mercedes Perez Quesada, said: 'The fraud was three-fold. 'Telesales operators contacted potential victims and offered them attractive prices to sell their timeshare properties and took advantage of their ignorance of Spanish law once they'd been tempted to instruct them to pay things like administrative or public notary fees. 'Any excuse to get money out of them was valid. 'Once victims had been conned and knew they were never going to get their money back, a second group of people would call claiming to be lawyers saying they were going to launch a group action on behalf of victims and asking once again for money upfront. 'The third tier involved people posing as court officials ringing victims and saying cases had been resolved in their favour but they had to pay fees so they could obtain their cash settlements. 'The scam sounds very crude but we estimate the fraudsters were making between £35 and £35,000 from victims and the fraud was netting between £3.5 million and £4.5 million a year. 'The telesales operators were at the bottom rung of the fraud but knew exactly what was going on. 'The next level up were front men paid to open bank accounts so it made it more difficult to find out where the money had gone. 'They would receive commissions on the transfers of up to £360...Money collectors working for the three alleged ringleaders would collect up to £2,150 from each front man on a daily basis and pass it on to their paymasters. 'The leaders were the brains behind the operation and the final recipients of the money... They started the operation we have smashed in 2009. Concern: Police fear there may be thousands more victims may be identified following a series of raids on the Costa del Sol (pictured) against the gang which had been operating for more than five years . The alleged ringleaders, who have not been named, are suspected of laundering the multi-million pound proceeds of their fraud through bars and restaurants on the Costa del Sol. Much of the money had been banked in offshore accounts. Two of the three alleged leaders were arrested along with 36 other suspects in raids in February during the first phase of the operation. The man police say is the ringleader was detained in a second phase after returning to Spain from the UK. A judge at a court in the Costa del Sol resort of Fuengirola is now coordinating an ongoing criminal investigation. He is probing 11 companies believed to have been set up to facilitate the fraud. Two men including the alleged ringleader have been remanded in jail after a closed court hearing and the remainder released on bail. None of the suspects have been formally charged as is customary under Spanish law, but are being probed on suspicion of money laundering, fraud and membership of a criminal gang. Inspector Perez said: 'We know so far this organisation defrauded 500 British victims out of money but we expect there are thousands of victims.' Police also admitted the alleged ringleader had been arrested before for similar offences. They were not able to say whether he had been convicted in court. Malaga police chief Pedro Garijo Torres said: 'We don't want to comment on things that escape our control. 'The important thing for us was the police operation which is of huge significance in an area like Malaga whose economy relies so heavily on tourism and foreign visitors.' Government spokesman for the area Jorge Hernandez Mollar described the police operation, involving financial crime specialists from Madrid and Malaga, as 'brilliant.'"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Spanish police arrest 56 Britons following a series of Costa del Sol raids .\nInvestigators have so far uncovered 500 victims of the timeshare scam .\nMajority of the victims are pensioners - and police fear there may be thousands more who will never be identified .\nScam involved calls from fake lawyers convincing victims to sell property .\nFraudsters then exploited the elderly ex-pats' ignorance of Spanish law to convince them to pay fake 'admin' charges of up to £35,000 ."}]}

While he was testifying at San Luis Obispo Superior Court last week, Andrew Gilbertson pulled some feces out of his pants and ate it. He was on trial for robbing a Bank of America branch in the central California city in 2013. Scroll down for video . Andrew Gilbertson was standing trial in San Luis Obispo Superior Court in California for a 2013 bank robbery . While he was testifying, the 40-year-old defendant reached into his pants, pulled out feces and then ate it . Gilbertson's attempt to convince the jury he was insane didn't work and he was found guilty of robbery . Gilbertson, 40, was pleading not guilty by reason of insanity and claimed he heard voices in his head, according to the San Luis Obispo Tribune. His defense attorney, Brian Buckley, apologized after the excrement eating. Buckley said: 'When I said this was going to be an unusual case, that wasn't what I was expecting.' Despite his unorthodox attempt to convince the jury he was insane during the robbery, Gilbertson was found guilty of robbery and burglary. Deputy District Attorney Dave Pomeroy told the jury, who took about half a day to hand down the verdict, that Gilbertson was sane when he robbed the bank and when he ate his poop. Pomeroy said: 'That was upsetting a couple of days ago. 'Obviously, it was designed to produce emotion.' He added that Gilbertson showed off his hands during the stunt to 'be sure you all clearly understood what he had in his hand and what he was doing'.

The New York Post on Saturday claimed that Valerie Jarrett, a close confidant of both the president and First Lady Michelle Obama, divulged details of the story to the press through outside sources hoping it would not trace back to the White House. The bad press was reportedly timed to become public just as Clinton was planning to announce her candidacy for president. White House spokesman Josh Earnest indicated to reporters on Monday that the report wasn't true, though. Scroll down for video . A new report claims that it was a member of Hillary Clinton's (above) own party leaked to the press that the political heavyweight and likely presidential candidate was using a personal email address during her time as Secretary of State . Valerie Jarrett (left), one of President Barack Obama's (right) top advisers, reportedly leaked details of the story to the press through outside sources hoping it would not trace back to the White House . The story ran in the New York Post and was written by Ed Klein, who spoke last Wednesday about his belief Jarrett was involved on Fox and Friends . ‘It's utter baloney,' he said after a reporter asked him about the rumor at his regular briefing with the press. He did not comment further on the matter. According to the New York Post article, authored by Edward Klein, a source close to the White House disclosed that 'Obama and Valerie Jarrett will go to any lengths to prevent Hillary from becoming president.' 'They believe that Hillary, like her husband, is left of center, not a true-blue liberal.' Sources claim that the long rumored tension between Obama and the Clintons hit a high when during the midterm elections many members of the Democrat Party refused to be seen campaigning with President Obama. Jarrett is reported to have commented that the defections were linked to the Clintons, who she believed had begun 'marginalizing the president' and were 'trying to wrestle control of the Democratic Party away from Obama.' She reportedly went out of her way to exact revenge, working to get Monica Lewinsky high-profile press opportunities and frequently complaining about the Clintons. Then, shortly after the midterm elections, she, the president and the first lady, reportedly sat down with Clinton and told her in no uncertain terms that they planned on remaining neutral during the presidential primary should she run for president. This as Jarrett is reported to have been speaking to Martin O’Malley, the former governor of Maryland, and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts about possibly running in the 2016 election. 'She’s promised O’Malley and Warren the full support of the White House if they will challenge Hillary for the presidential nomination,' a source who spoke to Klein allegedly said. Jarrett has reportedly been speaking to Martin O’Malley (above), the former governor of Maryland, about running in 2016 . She has also reportedly reached out to Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts about entering the primary . Klein, the author of Blood Feud: The Clintons vs. the Obamas, also says he spoke to a friend of the Clintons, who told him that Bill said; 'My contacts and friends in newspapers and TV tell me that they’ve been contacted by the White House and offered all kinds of negative stories about us.' He then added; 'The Obamas are behind the e-mail story, and they’re spreading rumors that I’ve been with women, that Hillary promoted people at the State Department who’d done favors for our foundation, that John Kerry had to clean up diplomatic messes Hillary left behind.' And it's not over yet, as according to Klein, six additional probes into Clinton's performance are underway. Bill, upon learning of this, reportedly said to a friend; 'The Obamas are out to get us any way they can.' Klein seems to have known about all this for some time, having discussed it when he appeared on Fox and Friends last Wednesday. '[Bill] has said, according to my sources, that the White House is leaking to their friends in the mainstream media stories about the Clintons. Not only about Hillary, but about him, and about what she did while she was in the State Department,' Klein claimed. 'This is from sources within the White House, that the Clintons know that Hillary is under not one, but six different investigations prompted by the White House.' He then added; 'They're going through these, looking for problems on her expense account, on her dealings with foreign leaders. All of this, I'm told, is prompted by Valerie Jarrett and the president, who do not want to see Hillary Clinton become President of the United States.' Jarrett, 58, is one of President Obama’s longest serving advisers. She said in a recent interview that she would stay in the White House 'until the lights go off.'"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Weekend report claimed that Valerie Jarrett, one of President Barack Obama's top advisers, leaked the Hillary Clinton email scandal to the press .\nWhat's more, the leak was reportedly planned to hit at the same time Clinton planned to announce her run for presidency .\nThe New York Post claims Jarrett was angry that the Clintons had been working to 'marginalize' President Obama .\nJarrett allegedly blames the Clintons for members of the Democratic party refusing to campaign with Obama during the midterm elections .\nSix more probes into Clinton reportedly underway; more leaks expected .\nPresident Obama allegedly told Clinton in a meeting with Jarrett and the First Lady that he would not support her in the presidential primary ."}]}

It is indeed true that millions of Americans are now newly enrolled into health insurance, but it is disingenuous to tout this as a great success. An estimated 71% of the new insurance arises through Medicaid, using 2014 calculations based on analysis by Haislmaier and Gonshorowski of data from the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare. The harsh reality awaiting these low-income Americans is undeniable: according to 2013 data from a 2014 Merritt Hawkins study, 55% of doctors already refuse new Medicaid patients. According to the HSC Health Tracking Physician Survey, 2008, the percentage of doctors that refuse new Medicaid patients dwarf by about 8 to 10 times the percentage that refuses new private insurance patients. Such \"insurance\" from Obamacare not only fails to provide access to doctors, but research in the top medical journals such as Cancer, American Journal of Cardiology, Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation and Annals of Surgery, show that Medicaid beneficiaries suffer worse outcomes than similar patients with private insurance  ... all at an added cost of another $800 billion by CBO estimates to taxpayers after the decade. It is not hyperbole to call Medicaid a disgrace at its annual cost of about $450 billion, and expanding it rather than helping poor people buy private insurance is simply inexplicable. Health care access for middle-class Americans is also significantly worsened by Obamacare's private insurance decrees. The law already forced termination of health insurance for millions of Americans estimated as 4.7 million by the Associated Press --  insurance they personally had chosen to buy. The Congressional Budget Office now projects that a stunning 10 million Americans will be forced off their chosen employer-based health insurance by 2021 -- a tenfold increase in the number that was initially projected back in 2011, at the onset of the law. Along with that forced change of coverage, many suddenly find themselves without access to their chosen doctors. Despite the assertion that the law increases insurance choices, the Obamacare exchanges do quite the opposite for those dependent on them and their government's subsidies. McKinsey reported 68% of Obamacare insurance options only cover narrow or very narrow provider networks, double that of the previous year. For cancer care, the majority of America's best hospitals in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network are not covered in most of their states' exchange plans. The \"narrow network\" strategy is about to hit even more Americans in 2015, as Obamacare exchanges from California to New Hampshire further restrict access to top doctors and hospitals in an attempt to quell insurance premium increases caused by the law itself, according to an analysis by the Los Angeles Times. And a study in late 2014 commissioned by the prestigious American Heart Association determined that the specialists essential to diagnose and treat stroke, one of the most disabling and lethal diseases in the United States, are in severe shortage under Obamacare insurance exchange plans. Indeed, unless one has the financial resources or power to skirt the new system, many of America's top doctors and hospitals are no longer available. Obamacare has forced Americans onto a far more government-dominated health care pathway than in the past. Coupled with population aging, the 107 million under the government's Medicaid or Medicare insurance in 2013 will rapidly increase to 135 million just five years later, a growth rate tripling that of private insurance. By the end of the decade, a full 140 million Americans will have their health care access directly controlled by government insurance, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid. More doctors than ever  already refuse Medicaid and Medicare due to inadequate payments for care, and that will only accelerate as government lowers reimbursements. Less appreciated is that inadequate payments to doctors by government insurance substantially increase private insurance premiums. Back in 2008, a shortfall of over $88 billion of payment from Medicaid and Medicare beneficiaries added more than $1,500 extra per year in premiums and $1,800 extra in total out-of-pocket costs to every family of four with private insurance. As the government increases its role as insurer, it increases its hold on payments to doctors and hospitals, so it will be able to reduce reimbursements and dictate access to limited networks of doctors and hospitals. And with increasing enrollment into government insurance, private premiums will undoubtedly rise even more. It is therefore absolutely critical for the new Congress to reject Obamacare and instead help individual Americans and their families, particularly middle class and poor Americans -- the people most harmed by Obamacare. Any legitimate health reform plan must be focused on three goals: 1) help consumers find affordable private insurance suited to their personal needs; 2) liberate the poor from Medicaid so they have actual access to medical care, as well as the dignity of personal choice of doctor; and 3) add substantive mechanisms that reduce health care costs by competition and value-seeking by consumers. The plan should not replicate the false claims of Obamacare supporters that recent slowdowns in health spending from economic downturns were somehow caused by Obamacare. The Patient Choice, Affordability, Responsibility, and Empowerment (PatientCARE) Act put forth this month by leading Republicans in Congress tries to do just that. This bill, also known as Coburn-Burr-Hatch, represents a serious plan to expand access to health care and reduce the nation's health care expenses. The Coburn-Burr-Hatch proposal incentivizes people to buy insurance they value, and it generates affordable options, instead of forcing the purchase of expensive insurance that individuals don't want. Current harmful barriers to interstate cooperation and anti-competitive impediments are reduced. Health savings plans are liberalized to allow everyone, not just the affluent, control over their health care dollar. Medicaid reforms provide options for individuals to buy private coverage, and the government provides significant financial support for lower income Americans. And no one is forced to spend their hard-earned money on something they do not want. As the Supreme Court hears arguments Wednesday about the legitimacy of subsidies under the ACA, Americans must recognize the bigger picture about U.S. health reform. Contrary to the mantra that the GOP has no plan other than to repeal Obamacare, the truth is that it is the supporters of Obamacare are the ones who are single-minded. They are focused on maintaining the ACA without regard for legitimate reforms to improve health care access and quality and without finally addressing what always was the most important problem with US health care -- its cost. Responsible leadership must focus on empowering patients instead of the government, before private health insurance and with that access to the excellence of America's medical system are eliminated for all but the affluent. Empowering individuals -- regardless of socioeconomic status -- with choices and information in order to facilitate access to care from the best doctors and hospitals in the world should be the thrust of any change to American health care. That's an American solution, and it's up to our elected officials to make sure it finally happens."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Scott Atlas: Nearly three-quarters of those insured under Obamacare were added to Medicaid .\nAccess to the best doctors is very limited; patients often have little choice of doctors, he says ."}]}

His exploits at Barcelona saw him claim a Champions League trophy in 2006, as well as shaping a team that became the best in the world. An individual master and former Ballon d'Or winner, the Brazilian playmaker has also played with some of the finest stars on the planet. He is therefore well placed to select his Champions League dream team. Take a look at his eleven talented picks below. Ronaldinho is surrounded by the media as he celebrates with the Champions League trophy in 2006 . The Brazilian playmaker enjoyed successful spells in Europe with Barcelona (left) and AC Milan (right) Ronaldinho was a key part of one of the best teams on the planet... so what's his Champions League XI? GOALKEEPER . Gianluigi Buffon . Although Ronaldinho never featured on the same team as the Italian stopper, his record in Europe speaks for itself. 135 Champions League and UEFA Cup appearances; the most expensive goalkeeper of all time enjoyed individual and team success with Parma and Juventus. Ronaldinho's verdict: 'There have been some very good goalkeepers in my era, but Buffon is there for consistency. Most of the goalkeepers have had times when their form has not been so good, but Buffon has been at such a high level for so long.' Gianluigi Buffon makes Ronaldinho's Champions League dream team because of his consistency at the top . DEFENCE . Cafu . The Brazilian full back defined an era for his position, bombing down the flank as Brazil's class of 2002 were heralded as one of the best of all time. Spells in Italy with Roma and AC Milan saw Cafu bring his attacking nature to Europe, and he captured the Champions League in 2007 in his penultimate season as a professional. Ronaldinho's verdict: 'You don’t become the most capped player in Brazil’s history, without being very special. I was so happy when he finally won the Champions League with Milan, for the best right back ever not to win the biggest club trophy would not be right.' Ronaldinho describes Cafu as the 'best right back ever' - he is the most capped player in Brazil's history . Cafu had spells in Europe with AC Milan and Roma, and finally claimed glory in the Champions League in 2007 . John Terry . A mainstay in Chelsea's back four for over a decade, Terry was involved in several fierce battles with Ronaldino in the Champions League and was able to lift the trophy in 2012. The no nonsense captain has dedicated himself to the Blues, and has been rewarded with 13 major club honours. Ronaldinho's verdict: 'We [Barcelona] had some big Champions League games against Chelsea, and I could see then why John Terry is still so important for them now. He is very tough to play against, but he is a fantastic leader, the leader you need in those sorts of games.' Chelsea's John Terry tries to tackle Barca star Ronaldinho during a Champions League tie at the Nou Camp . Paolo Maldini . Another one-club man, Maldini won 26 trophies during his glittering 24-year career with Milan. A typical quick, elegant and colossal Italian defender, he holds the record for appearances in UEFA club competitions at 173, as well as netting the fastest ever goal in a Champions League final in 2005 (50 secs, vs Liverpool). Oh, and a haul of five European Cup winners' medals (1989, 1990, 1994, 2003 and 2007) isn't bad either. Ronaldinho's verdict: 'He was one of the best defenders in Champions League history, but what was so impressive about him is that when he was on the ball he didn’t look like a defender, but like an elegant midfield player.' Paolo Maldini (right) holds the record for appearances in UEFA club competitions and is an AC Milan legend . Roberto Carlos . Like Cafu, a marauding defender who brought the art of Brazilian flair to defending. Claimed three Champions League titles with Real Madrid (1998, 2000, 2002) and was a true Galactico at the Bernabeu. Netting three goals in 161 European outings, Carlos also had a ferocious left foot. Ronaldinho's verdict: 'Would be worth having in any team for his ability to take free kicks, but as well as being one of the best free kick takers ever, he is also one of the finest left backs ever. So important to all of Real Madrid’s Champions League wins.' Ronaldinho taps Brazil team-mate Roberto Carlos on the head during a training session in 2006 . The Real Madrid left back was known for his attacking prowess, as well as his fierce left-footed free kicks . MIDFIELD . Claude Makelele . His exploits with Real Madrid and Chelsea saw a holding midfield role named after him, so Makelele ought to have claimed more than the one Champions League final success (2002). Small in height but pulled no punches in the tackle, Jose Mourinho built a successful team around the Frenchman at Stamford Bridge. Ronaldinho's verdict: 'Defenders feel safe knowing that he is ahead of them, the attackers feel safe knowing he is behind them, for me he is the best I have ever seen doing the job of protecting the defence. You never saw him play a bad game.' Claude Makelele tries to tackle Ronaldinho during a second leg tie at Stamford Bridge . The 'Makelele role' became famous after the Frenchman's successful spell at Chelsea . Frank Lampard . The model goalscoring midfielder over the last decade, Lampard's late surges into the box were a driving force for Chelsea and he finally claimed the European Cup in 2012 after a victory against Bayern Munich. The England international scored 23 goals in 106 appearances in the Champions League. Ronaldinho's verdict: 'I told Frank Rijkaard that we (Barcelona) should sign him, but he didn’t want to leave Chelsea. I am sure they would not have let him go, at that time he was one of the greats in Europe. His goal record from midfield was what really impressed me.' Frank Lampard and Ronaldinho shake hands after an entertaining fixture in 2006 . The Brazilian says he urged Frank Rijkaard to sign the England midfielder, and praises his goal record . Kaka . When Ronaldinho left Barcelona for Milan in 2008, he linked up with his Brazil team-mate and Ballon d'Or winner. Although his record move to Real Madrid did not quite work out, Kaka's influence and elegance in the No 10 role in a team that reached two Champions League finals in three years (2005 and 2007, winning the second) must not be forgotten. Ronaldinho's verdict: 'Things did not work out for Kaka as well as expected at Madrid, but we must not forget the player at Milan who was the real Kaka. For two, maybe three seasons he was the best player in the world, there was nothing he couldn’t do.' Brazil team-mates Ronaldinho and Kaka pose for photographers at a press conference in 2005 . The duo went on to play with each other at AC Milan, Ronaldinho says he was 'the best player in the world' ATTACK . Lionel Messi . If anyone was to usurp Ronaldinho at Barcelona, they would have to be some player. Lionel Messi is that man. The record goalscorer in the European Cup (75), three Ballon d'Ors, and three Champions League titles (2006, 2009, 2011) in one of the greatest club side's in history, the Argentine forward has it all. Ronaldinho's verdict: 'I have won everything, it is impossible for me to have regrets. I do wish though that I could have played with Messi for longer than I did at Barcelona. There are no words to describe him; he just has magic in his feet.' Lionel Messi has won it all in Europe - three Champions League winners' medals and three Balon d'Ors . Messi usurped Ronaldinho at Barcelona but he holds no grudges toward his former team-mate . Thierry Henry . Combined grace and speed with a sublime eye for goal, and came so close to Champions League glory with Arsenal in 2006. The club's record goalscorer opted for pastures new when Barcelona came calling, but only briefly played with Ronaldinho. A European Cup followed in 2009, and Henry finished with a record of almost one in two in European competitions. Ronaldinho's verdict: 'My good friend who I played with at Barcelona, and there was even a chance that we nearly played together again in New York. Just a nightmare for defenders, was quick, had skill, and was strong.' Ronaldinho didn't get to work with Thierry Henry for long at Barcelona but praises his speed and skill . Henry is Arsenal's record goalscorer and has a fine record in European competitions . Ronaldo . One of the greatest finishers to ever grace the planet, Ronaldo had the world watching his every move on the pitch as he dazzled with Brazil, Barcelona, Inter Milan and Real Madrid. He scored 49 goals in 93 European appearances, but unfortunately never lifted the Champions League trophy. Ronaldinho's verdict: 'He was my idol and then I end up playing and winning a World Cup with him. The most complete striker there has ever been, the most complete striker there will ever be, it is almost unbelievable to think that he never won the Champions League.' Ronaldinho described Brazil team-mate Ronaldo (right) as the 'most complete striker there will ever be' Ronaldo celebrates after scoring against Manchester United in a quarter-final clash at Old Trafford in 2003 .

The 29-year-old striker enjoyed a dream start to life at St Mary's after moving from Feyenoord in a reported £9million summer deal. Pelle scored nine goals in his first 12 matches for Saints in all competitions and netted the winner on his debut for Italy. Graziano Pelle (19) has struggled with form recently and wasn't happy at being dropped for the first time . The goals have dried up of late, though, and he was replaced in the starting line-up by Shane Long in Sunday's 1-1 draw at Chelsea. Pelle ran straight down the tunnel at the final whistle, having played the final few minutes, and Koeman hopes the striker can end his three-month wait for a Premier League goal when Burnley visit this weekend. 'There has been a little bit of a reaction, yes, because nobody is happy to stay on the bench,' the Saints boss said. Ronald Koeman (centre) says he's 'seen a reaction' from Pelle after leaving him on the bench against Chelsea . 'Sometimes you need a reaction off the player in that situation. He is doing well. 'In that game, in that moment, I think it was good to change the way of playing with more fast players up front. Saturday we play at home.' Koeman has no fresh injury worries to contend with against Burnley, with Eljero Elia coming back into contention after missing last week's match through injury. Sean Dyche's relegation-threatened side head to St Mary's buoyed by last weekend's shock win over champions Manchester City and having overcome Southampton 1-0 earlier in the season. 'Yeah, they beat us but it wasn't a very good game that day and we missed a penalty,' Koeman said. The targetman was in superb form at the start of the season and scored nine goals in 12 matches . 'It was a stupid goal against us but, of course, we analyse always the opponent and we play 11 against 11 and then one team is playing like Burnley. 'Sometimes it is difficult to prepare a training session for the match, but we expect an aggressive opponent who will press us with direct play. 'That is always difficult because they don't give you time to play and you have to that and you have to prepare for that.' Saturday's match will be their last before a two-week international break, during which time many of Southampton's players will be away with their national teams. Martin Odegaard (left) was linked with a loan move to the Saints next season but Koeman denied the claims . England duo Nathaniel Clyne and Fraser Forster are amongst those players, with some eyebrows raised by the fact left-back Ryan Bertrand did not join them in Roy Hodgson's squad. 'I am not surprised,' Koeman said. 'He had suspension for three games. After that he came back and is playing well. 'I think he played very well against Chelsea but I am not surprised because his time will come if he keeps working like this, keeps playing like this.' The 16-year-old signed for Real Madrid from Norwegian side Strømsgodset and big things are expected . Meanwhile, Koeman downplayed speculation linking Southampton with a loan move for talented Real Madrid teenager Martin Odegaard. 'It is not my job to do scouting of young players,' he said of the 16-year-old Norwegian midfielder. 'He moved to Real Madrid - that means that he is a very good player.'"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Ronald Koeman admits he's seen a reaction from striker Graziano Pelle .\nThe Italian was benched for Southampton's game away to Chelsea .\nKoeman is happy to see Pelle show some passion and has done well since .\nThe Dutchman refuted claims that Saints are interested in Martin Odegaard .\nClick here for all the latest Southampton news ."}]}

They are pastimes that millions of us do every week to keep relatively fit and healthy. Dancing, gardening and walking up hills are all well-known as simple exercises that would help to fight the flab. But the health watchdog NICE believes we should be given official guidance to remind those who don’t bother - and that we should keep a daily diary alongside details of meals, snacks and drinks. The watchdog warns to pay particular attention to lattes, high protein drinks, nuts and alcohol which contain hidden calories they may not realise they have consumed. It is estimated that a quarter of adults in the UK are obese although this is projected to increase to almost two thirds by 2050. The condition is thought to cost the health service and economy £16 billion a year through medical treatment, sick days and benefits. Officials from NICE hope that encouraging adults to ‘self-monitor’ their activity and food intake will prompt them to adopt healthier lifestyles. They are particularly concerned that the emergence of a ‘coffee culture’ in recent years has led to Britons consuming calorie-laden lattes and muffins on top of their meals and snacks. Guidance also points out that many adults who do exercise underdo the good work immediately afterwards by ‘refuelling’ on high sugar sports drinks and protein shakes. Additionally, the watchdog instructs parents to avoid giving children sweets at weekends, the school holidays or even for good behaviour. Even in small amounts, they can ‘disrupt’ everyday healthy eating habits and lead to obesity, they state. Scroll down for video . They also encourage parents to ensure children get at least nine to ten hours sleep a night as staying up late is linked to being overweight. Other recommendations include urging adults not to drink too much alcohol as this also contains high numbers of hidden calories. It points out that even if a woman sticks within the recommended safe limits of 2 to 3 units a day – a large glass of wine – this contains as many calories as Mars bar. Don't undo good work at the gym by drinking protein shakes or high sugar sports drinks afterwards. Avoid calorific coffees like lattes – and the muffins and cakes that come with them. Remember nuts and alcohol have 'hidden calories'. Don't allow children more than two hours of 'screen time' a day – which includes watching TV or playing handheld video games. Have 'TV-free' days and go on a walk or cycle-ride instead. Source: NICE guidance . Professor Gillian Leng, Deputy Chief Executive at NICE, said: ‘Overweight and obesity is an enormous concern for the health service in England, it has a huge personal health cost to the individual and the financial impact of dealing with obesity and its associated conditions and its associated conditions is creating a significant burden on the NHS. ‘A significant amount of effort is needed to lose weight and keep it off. This guidance sets out the many things individuals can do to maintain a healthy weight that are known to be effective. Professor Susan Jebb, an expert in diet and population health at the University of Oxford, said: ‘In 21st century Britain most people are less active than recommended for good health and it is all too easy to eat more calories than we need – weight gain is unfortunately all too common. ‘The recommendations emphasise the value of reducing the consumption of energy-dense foods and the amount of time spent sitting down and inactive.’ The guidance also states that ideally, children should have no more than two hours screen time a day – which includes watching TV or playing handheld video games. Parents are also encouraged to have TV-free days either weekly or monthly and spend the time going for a walk or cycle ride. Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum said: ‘Finally NICE is getting the message, sometimes you have to be cruel to be kind. ‘Children, and maybe their parents too, will rebel against the advice that sweets should never be offered as treats on any day of the year - but both will welcome the advice long-term.’ Move more: It also suggests people try and get more active to keep their weight within healthy levels . Only yesterday the head of the NHS Simon Stevens launched an initiative that will very overweight patients referred for cookery classes and Zumba keep fit sessions. Sessions paid for by the health service will teach adults to boil, grill and steam food rather than dunking them in the frying pan. They will also receive vouchers to attend exercise sessions at local community centres or gyms."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Health watchdog NICE advises keeping a diary of every morsel consumed .\nWarns recent addition of calorie-laden lattes is adding to obesity epidemic .\nSuggests limiting children's 'screen time' to just two hours a day .\nHopes advice will cut the numbers of overweight people in the UK ."}]}

Crowds and stars have been considered as part of a Sportsmail study to explore which English clubs are the ‘biggest’; 58 different teams of the current 92 in the top four divisions have been included in the study, having played in England’s top division for at least a season. Two different measurements were used for crowds - the average gates for each club this season, plus the biggest gate each club has ever had at any point. The aim of this was to gauge not just one season but reflect former ‘greatness’ for clubs now enduring leaner times but who were authentic giants at some point. Manchester United, averaging over 75,000 fans every game at Old Trafford, top the crowds list . This is what Maine Road looked like in 1934, the year Manchester City recorded a record attendance of 84,569 . Arsenal's Emirates Stadium sees them second in attendances for this season, and fourth overall on crowds . CLICK HERE to see Sportsmail's definitive list of the BIGGEST clubs in England . United’s current average attendances of more than 75,000 leaves them way ahead of the field, with Arsenal in second place just below 60,000, then Newcastle (nearly 51,000), Manchester City (45,400), Liverpool (44,700), with Chelsea, Sunderland, Everton, Tottenham and West Ham filling out the top 10. All 59 clubs in the study have been ranked on current attendances, and separately on their biggest historic gates. An aggregate of those two ranks gives the overall crowd ranking topped by United, with City in second place, then Chelsea, Arsenal and Sunderland. City have the highest single attendance for a home club match in English football - almost 85,000 were at Maine Road for the game in question, an FA Cup tie against Stoke in 1934. United are the club with the next biggest home record, just over 83,000 for a league match with Arsenal in 1948. We ranked all clubs on the size of their average gates during this season to reflect contemporary pull. Then we ranked each club by the size of their biggest historic gates. Their overall crowd rank is an aggregate of current pull and also potential based on past highs. Incidentally, this was also played at Maine Road, which United were using at that time because Old Trafford had been so damaged in the blitz. Eight other clubs also have record home attendances of more than 70,000: Chelsea, Everton, Aston Villa, Sunderland, Tottenham, Charlton, Arsenal and Sheffield Wednesday and these all-time highs are reflective of these clubs having massive paying support in different eras. AFC Wimbledon's support may be loud and loyal, but they are bottom of our list in terms of crowds . With Kingsmeadow one of the Football League's smallest grounds, AFC Wimbledon rank low on attendance . We counted the number of players from each club who have played for England, all-time, ranking the clubs by total. This reflects historic ‘bigness’. We then ranked the clubs by the number of players provided to the 2014 World Cup — a measure of modern ‘bigness’. The overall ranking is an aggregate of these two. To measure the amount of ‘star’ players at each club, both all-time and more recently, our study used two objective criteria - the number of players capped by England at each club, ever, and the number of players called up by their countries for the most recent World Cup. The notion of ‘stars’ will always be subjective. That is a given. But using proxies of England players over time and World Cup players last summer allowed hard data to compare all the clubs on a like-for-like basis. The clubs have been ranked on each criteria with an aggregate ranking to determine the ‘biggest’ clubs in terms of all-time stars. Using this method, United and Liverpool are joint top. Liverpool have provided the third most England players, all-time (67), behind Aston Villa in first place (73) and Tottenham (71). They also provided the joint third-most players of all the clubs in the English league to the World Cup (10). Manchester United had the most players of any English team at the World Cup, including Wayne Rooney . Liverpool were third for number of players at the World Cup, including Luis Suarez and Steven Gerrard . Fabian Delph is the only Aston Villa in the current England squad, but they top the historical list . United provided the most players to the World Cup of all English clubs (14), followed by Chelsea (12) then Liverpool, Arsenal and City on 10 each. United have provided the fifth most England players, or 65 to date. Thus both Liverpool and United’s aggregate ‘star player’ rankings are the same. Our ‘star player’ index has Arsenal and Tottenham in joint third, followed by Everton, City and Chelsea in joint fifth, then Aston Villa in eighth, Newcastle in ninth, with West Brom and Southampton joint 10th.

Vettori flew from Melbourne with his team-mates on Wednesday to prepare for the final against the winner of Thursday's match between Australia and India in Sydney. He will play his 295th one-dayer for New Zealand at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Sunday, 18 years and four days since he played his first. Vettori made his debut for New Zealand against Sri Lanka in 1997, aged 18. He has since taken 305 wickets and scored more than 2,200 one-day runs and will retire, aged 36, as New Zealand's most-capped player. Daniel Vettori said it is 'pretty obvious' he will retire after Sunday's World Cup final in Melbourne . Vettori poses for a picture on arrival at Melbourne Airport on Wednesday with the New Zealand team . Vettori said 'it's not what I'm thinking about. It's about enjoying the game, enjoying the build-up to a World Cup final.' New Zealand booked their place in the MCG showpiece with a thrilling four-wicket victory over South Africa at Eden Park in Auckland. The co-hosts have won all eight matches so far in the tournament on their way to the final. Former New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming heaped praise on current incumbent Brendon McCullum for leading the Kiwis into their first ever World Cup final. The Black Caps had on six previous occasions reached the last four, including twice under Fleming, but never made the final. Vettori and Grant Elliott steered New Zealand to a thrilling final over, four-wicket victory over South Africa . Fleming, one of New Zealand's most successful captains, knows the setbacks his country have endured in the global tournament and admitted his incredulity at their feat in his column on the International Cricket Council's website. He said: 'There is a dream-like euphoria mixed with a pinch-me feeling of disbelief throughout the country, given the Black Caps' success in winning their way through to Melbourne and Sunday's final has finally smashed that World Cup glass ceiling by banishing all the years of semi-final heartaches. 'As a captain who suffered two of those heartaches, in 1999 and 2007, to see a New Zealand side playing with the freedom and quality that Brendon McCullum and his players are producing certainly warms the heart.' New Zealand captain Brendan McCullum arrives at Melbourne Airport on Wednesday . Ross Taylor was all smiles at Melbourne Airport as New Zealand arrived for the World Cup final . Tim Southee signs an autograph for a spectator at Melbourne Airport after a flight from New Zealand . Fleming, who played 111 Tests and 280 one-day internationals, knows their supporters will be outnumbered, whoever triumphs in the second semi-final, but hopes they can reproduce the form that has got them this far. 'It will be a tough one to negotiate,' he added. 'Either way, New Zealand will know they will face a crowd in which their own supporters will be in the minority by quite some margin. 'I am not sure it matters who McCullum's men end up playing because either opponent at this stage of the tournament will be top-notch. 'But the quality the Black Caps have produced has been exceptional time and time again in this tournament and I just hope they can do it once more on Sunday.

Additionally, modern pot has very low levels of cannabidiol, or CBD, the compound that medical marijuana advocates say gives the drug its healing properties. In most samples, the CBD levels were so small they were undetectable. The findings come from Andy LaFrate, a Ph.D. chemist and the founder of Colorado testing firm Charas Scientific. LaFrate will present the results of his research today at the national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Denver. Scroll down for video . Andy LaFrate, the founder of Charas Scientific, knows that most people think it's a joke when he says he tested 600 samples of Colorado's legal pot . In fact, LaFrate used highly accurate liquid chromatography to isolate all of the compounds within the marijuana samples - and got some surprising results . LaFrate's survey of Colorado's marijuana casts doubt on claims that by legalizing the drug for recreational use in 2012, it would make it safer to consume. 'It's pretty startling just how dirty a lot of this stuff is,' he told Smithsonian.com. Also alarming is the fact that people using marijuana for its reported medicinal properties usually have no way of knowing how much CBD is actually in their products. Colorado only requires marijuana dispensaries to test and advertise the levels of THC - the compound in pot that gets user 'high.' CBD and contaminant levels are not tested. 'I've heard a lot of complaints from medical patients because somebody claims that a product has a high level of CBD, and it turns out that it actually doesn't,' LaFrate says. Children who are given marijuana to control epilepsy can actually be worse off because they're being given strains of the drug with virtually no CBD and high levels of THC, which can trigger seizures, he added. LaFrate's tests used liquid chromatography, a highly accurate method of chemical analysis that separates out the component parts of a substance. LaFrate says more testing is needed on the effects of contaminants on people who consume marijuana . He found that Colorado's legal marijuana has THC levels of 18 to 20percent. Sometimes THC is as high as 30percent. Marijuana from the 1980s usually had THC levels of less than 10percent - meaning modern pot is two to three times stronger than it was a generation ago. It's no coincidence that Colorado's marijuana is dramatically stronger and has dramatically lower CBD levels than the pot of yesteryear. Growers responded to a demand from consumers for more potent pot by breeding varieties with higher levels of THC and less CBD. LaFrate says he found very small levels of genetic variation between 'strains' of marijuana. This means, the claims of pot with exotic names - 'Skunkberry,' 'Ghost Train Haze,' 'Girl Scout Cookies' - are usually just slick marketing ploys. Additionally, much of Colorado's marijuana is contaminated with high levels of fungus spores and bacteria. It's not known what levels of those microorganisms are safe for marijuana and more study on the subject is needed, LaFrate says. Many samples also contained traces of cancer-causing heavy metals, which come from the plants growing in contaminated soil. Others had high levels of pesticides. LaFrate warned that the marijuana growing industry is getting by on it's hippy reputation and that many consumers believe the plants are grown naturally using organic methods - when in fact, that usually is not the case at all. Even more troubling were the 200 samples of marijuana concentrates - or pot extract - that LaFrate tested. These are used to make edibles and can contain up to 90percent THC. Because they are concentrated doses, they can also contain very high levels of heavy metals and pesticides - as the THC level is dialed up, so are the levels of background contaminants. The solvents used like alcohol and heptane to make the concentrates also contribute startling levels of contaminants, LaFrate warned."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Modern pot also has very low levels of cannabidiol, or CBD, the compound that advocates say gives marijuana its medicinal properties .\nColorado weed has THC levels of 18 to 20percent - sometime as high as 30percent .\nMarijuana 30 years ago had THC levels of less than 10percent .\nFindings come from Dr Andy LaFrate, who tested 600 marijuana samples with liquid chromatography .\nAlso found high levels of fungus, bacteria, heavy metals, pesticides and other contaminants in much of the pot ."}]}

Grammy-winning Taylor, 25, attributes a huge slice of her global success to her energetic stage performances and her team have apparently looked into how much it would cost to insure her legs against potential career-threatening accidents. The Pennsylvania-raised star is embarking upon a global tour in May and the move is said to be a precaution against such a physically-demanding schedule. Scroll down for video . Diamonds in those heels: Taylor Swift's super-slim legs have reportedly been insured for a whopping £26.5million ahead of her gruelling world tour which begins in May . Prized assets: Taylor's pins, on display (left) at the Saturday Night Live anniversary special last month, are considered a key part of her high-energy stage performances. Showing them off at a pre-Grammy Gala in LA in February (right) The Blank Space singer is reported to have said she was 'embarrassed' at how much her slender limbs are said to be worth. Celebrity insurers Lloyd's, which has specialised in offering body-part policies since the 1930s, said they were not surprised by the vast sums attributed to Taylor's pins. Underwriter Jonathan Thomas told FEMAIL: 'Taylor Swift’s income-generating capacity is hugely dependent upon her stage presence and thus her exceptional legs are indeed very likely worth millions of dollars of insurance.' She's certainly not the first celebrity to insure herself, however, with a whole host of other stars on record for ensuring their prize assets, which they often consider the key to their success, are protected by policy. Long before Kim Kardashian's derriere arrived on the scene, Jennifer Lopez famously insured her perfectly-round bottom for millions of dollars. Australian singer Kylie Minogue, whose rear grabbed the headlines in gold hotpants in the video for hit single Spinning Around back in 2000 was said to have insured her behind shortly after to the tune of £3million. That booty! J-Lo (left) was the original doyenne of the derriere and is said to have a £17million premium protecting her bottom. Kylie Minogue (right) has a similar policy, worth £3million . Dolly Parton is as well-known for her 40DD chest as she is for her back-catalogue of country music hits and is alleged to have once insured them for £3.8million - or £1.9million each. Bruce Springsteen's relentless live dates contribute hugely to his overall fortune so he needs more than the price of honey and lemon to keep his voice safe - the vocal chords of 'the Boss' are covered for up to £3million. For obvious reasons, sports stars can also have high premiums attached to certain parts of their anatomies. Although it's common practice for football clubs to insure against injury, a career-threatening tackle on a higher-profile star could potentially lose the club millions in sponsorship deals. In 2006, it was revealed that David Beckham had insured his cross-whipping legs against injury for around £100million while playing for Paris Saint-Germain. While in 2013, Portuguese star Cristiano Ronaldo's club Real Madrid renewed their insurance for his lightning-quick legs at a cost estimated to be around £74million. Legs eleven: When David Beckham was competing at a professional level, his goal-scoring limbs had a whopping £100million price tag on them. The Boss, aka Bruce Springsteen, is so protective of his lucrative voice that he's insured it for £3million . No need for a stuntman: 007 star Daniel Craig insisted on doing many of his own action scenes in the 2008 Bond film Quantam of Solace...at a cost of £5million in insurance . In 2008, Daniel Craig insisted on doing many of his own stunts for Bond film Quantam of Solace. 'He does a lot more than Pierce used to do,' said the film's chief stunt coordinator Gary Powell at the time, '...and he's allowed to because he's capable of doing it. He thinks, \"You're paying to see me, and that's me doing it.\" He wants the audience to know.' It might have given the film's makers a headache though, for such daredevilry came at an eye-watering insurance price, said to be £5million. A head for business: The Only Way is Essex star Joey said last year that he would insure his perfectly coiffured hair for £1million...shortly after launching his D:Reem range of hair products for Tesco . Good golly, Miss Dolly: Country star Ms Parton has protected her surgically-enhanced bosom for £3.8million while trailing in her wake is reality tv star Holly Madison, who has a similar chest-protecting policy for £66,000 . Million-dollar smile, literally. Film actress Julia Roberts was the subject of an insurance policy that saw her pearly whites covered for just shy of £20million . Becoming savvy about protecting career-boosting parts of the body isn't a new phenomenon. As early as the 1930s celebrities became aware of how much certain bits of them can influence their success. Specialist insurers Lloyd’s say the entertainment industry developing in California in the early 20th century quickly appreciated just how much a film could gross if its central star's appearance was just right. Early film stars such as Cyd Charisse’s (legs) and Jimmy Durante (nose) chose the company to provide them with policies. Present-day clients include  burlesque star Holly Madison’s breasts and NFL player Troy Polamalu’s hair."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Blank Space singer is said to be 'embarrassed' by hefty insurance sum .\nThe star's team are protecting her prized assets ahead of world tour .\nOther celebrities who've famously insured parts of their anatomy include David Beckham (legs), Bruce Springsteen (voice) and Dolly Parton (chest)"}]}

If my father had not been brave and hungry for a better future in America, there would be one fewer public administrator, one fewer third grade teacher and one fewer student in medical school in my family. Had so many young people not given their youth, their energy, their strength and their love for this country, the America we know would not exist. I owe the America I know to my father and the many men that toiled long ago in the fields of our past. I owe my success to my father Herminio, mother Juanita and countless others that dreamed of a better tomorrow. They dreamed of a better tomorrow never knowing if they would reap the slightest of benefits from their hard work. Today I stand as a testimony to that dream. As a teenager, my father left his life of poverty in Mexico for the promise of a new life in the United States in 1959. The hard, physical work of picking crops in the fields of California, Arizona and Texas, earned him less than a dollar a day, once room and board was subtracted. The Braceros program granted him a work visa and when he finished the program, he began his path to citizenship. My father did not complete any formal education past fourth grade. In that era in Mexico, you had to pay for school past a certain grade and my father's family couldn't afford it. He was limited to menial work and low wages. Unlike my father, I wasn't born into a life destined for backbreaking labor. My dad brought us into a world with endless possibilities. The sky was truly the limit and for the first time in his life, my father had hope -- for us. Our upbringing was humble, but my parents provided for all 12 of us children. They taught each and every one of us the importance of education. Our childhood was filled with the joys of love, laughter and belief in God. My father created paradise in a modest, two-bedroom home in the inner city of San Antonio, Texas. Our eggs came fresh every morning from the miniature chickens we raised. We were raised to live off the land, just like our father did as a younger man. We had a goat, a turkey, a potbelly pig, ducks, geese and chickens. Many of my fondest memories were of feeding and tending to our animals. One would assume that we lived on a farm. But balancing a life of dual identities was not an easy feat for either my siblings or me. I recall having to wake up early on Sunday mornings to feed the chickens and collect the eggs, while my friends were going to the zoo, water park or the mall. When Mondays came around, I dreaded talking about what I did that weekend. I didn't want to be judged, so I always made something up. The frustration of not being able to fit in gave way when I started getting positive feedback at school. I was outperforming my peers in English and writing, and I was finally getting recognition by my teachers and classmates. I felt that I finally was doing something like everyone else. I excelled at school. I decided to take a chance and apply for college. I started at the University of Texas at San Antonio in fall 2002 and graduated with a bachelor's degree in English and a Master's in public administration. I was the first in my family to get a college degree -- I'm the seventh out of 12 children. All of my siblings after me went to college and today we have a public administrator, a teacher and a medical school student in the family. Now, I work in an urban school district as a site coordinator for the federal initiative Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs. The program sets out to make a college education a reality for underrepresented students and communities experiencing high poverty. I work to remove those barriers so that every one of my students has a chance at a life like the one that was given to me by my parents. I have given myself to a life of service. I am now responsible for helping many young children reach their potential and live a life our ancestors could only dream of. I am the dream. I am an American. And I am the proud son of an immigrant.

After splitting from her husband of eight years in 2014, Dayna Rumfelt, from Wasilla, Alaska, knew she didn't want her wedding dress hanging in her closet for the rest of her life. Her desire to rid herself of the memory-filled garment prompted her to devise Operation Destroy The Dress, a detailed plan which would enable Ms Rumfelt to wreak havoc on her gown by dragging it through the mud and donning it for a day of paintball shooting, among other things. 'It felt so freeing,' she told The Huffington Post. 'For a long time after my divorce, I felt like I had a monkey on my back dragging me down into the mud.' Dirty dress: Divorcee Dayna Rumfelt, from Wasilla, Alaska, spent seven months destroying her wedding gown, including covering it in mud, after she split with her husband of eight years in 2014 . Finally over: Operation Destroy The Dress ended when she set her gown ablaze in a backyard bonfire . She continued: 'When the dress adventure began, I started to feel that less and less.' Ms Rumfelt's adventure began when she was photographed modeling her white gown at the Rage City Rollergirls roller derby game, where she coached the skaters from the sidelines as a bench manager, all the while clad in her fancy frock. Her friend Spenard Itch, who was also helping from the sidelines, wore a suit so she could match Ms Rumfelt's bridal attire. Next Ms Rumfelt and her friend Laura Burns, who was also going through a divorce, wore their dresses as they jumped into Reed Lakes. Overdressed: Ms Rumfelt started her adventure by wearing her gown to a roller derby game . Support system: The 35-year-old and her friend Spenard Itch, who wore a suit to match her, posed for a photo during the game . Surprisingly, the murky lake water didn't affect her dresses appearance in anyway. 'It's funny how when you're getting married your wedding dress seems so fragile, but really when it comes down to it, those suckers are tough as nails,' she said. According to Ms Rumfelt, her dress was still in fine condition after it dried - albeit a bit smelly. Just when she was really about to get started, Ms Rumfelt was approached by  photographer Kathy Shifflett who asked if she wanted to star in her own trash the dress photoshoot. All together: Ms Rumfelt can be seen laughing with friends who joined her for this silly picture . Swim time: Ms Rumfelt and her friend Laura Burns, who was also going through a divorce at the time, wore their dresses to jump into Reed Lakes in the Talkeetna Mountains of Alaska . Bonding session: Ms Rumfelt laughed at the camera as she swam in the lake water . One captivating images shows her donning the dreaded dress after it was covered in mud, but even the dirt deposits didn't ruin its appearance. In fact, most of the mud washed out when she threw it in the washing machine. While Ms Rumfelt contemplated even more daring adventures with her gown, including ski diving, she got preoccupied with work and realized that she just wanted the dress out of her life once and for all. Her wedding gown met its final demise at a backyard bonfire - with the moment being captured by photographer Greg A Morgan. Watch out: Ms Rumfelt wore her dress to engage in a paintball battle . Stained gown: She struck a pose after her dress was hit with multiple yellow paintballs . Ms Rumfelt said setting her dress ablaze gave her a huge 'sense of relief'. 'The dress just had to go,' she said. Trash the dress photoshoots are gaining popularity with both jilted brides and happily married women, who want to give their gowns new life by destroying them. Last December, 23-year-old Shelby Swink, from Memphis, Tennessee, covered her bridal dress in paint and glitter after her boyfriend of four years called off their wedding just days before they planned on saying 'I do'. Meanwhile, the bridal photography trend has prompted many newlyweds to pose in mud, under water and covered in paint - ultimately destroying their gowns - for the sake of capturing the perfect picture. Fierce stare: Ms Rumfelt flexed her bicep for this captivating image .

While some of the presumed presidential candidate's party members have come to her defense, many lawmakers headed for the exits this week as reporters asked them for their opinion on the way Clinton handled her email while at the State Department. Democratic strategists were more willing discuss the scandal - but what they had to say, Clinton probably won't like. Democrats are running for cover this week as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton takes fire from the press for over her cyber hygiene. Officials at 1600 Pennsylvania now claim they didn't know that Clinton was solely using her personal email address to conduct government business . Officials at 1600 Pennsylvania now claim they didn't know that Clinton was solely using her personal email address to conduct government business until Congress reopened an investigation into the Benghazi attack. According to the Associated Press, it was the White House counsel's office that ordered the State Department to retrieve Clinton's old emails. That version of events was never relayed to the press at large, despite the fact that President Barack Obama's spokesman Josh Earnest spent the better part of his briefings with reporters on Tuesday and Wednesday answering questions about what the White House knew about Clinton's exclusive use of her personal email address, when it knew it, and a host of other related inquires. He deflected as often as possible and referred press to the State Department and Clinton. Earnest did note that Clinton's detractors and government watchdogs haven't provided 'any evidence' that would indicate that the former administration official and her team are 'not being forthright' about turning in copies of all of her email communications from her four years in the president's cabinet. His comments were hardly a ringing endorsement of Clinton's honesty, however. The White House got a break on Thursday when a snowstorm bore down on Washington, D.C., giving Earnest cause to cancel his daily meeting with the press corps. A large-scale, public Q and A session isn't likely to make Friday's schedule, either, as the president is travelling to South Carolina for an event at Benedict College. Usually a spokesperson for the president holds a small gaggle with press riding Air Force One on those days. Unwilling or unable to say who in at the State Department was responsible for making sure Clinton fully complied with the demand, the deputy spokesman there, Marie Harf, directed journalists to the former secretary of state. Pressed to declare that she was 'confident' that all of Clinton's pertinent emails were now in the possession of the federal government she said, 'what I’m saying is her staff has stated that anything related to her work has been given to the State Department.' 'But this is obviously a confirmation her staff has to make,' she added, after a reporter asked if she has any 'reason to doubt' the veracity of Clinton's claims. She said she did not. Former Obama adviser David Axelrod said Wednesday night that he thinks the Clinton is adding to her woes by keeping silent.'It would be good to get out there and answer these questions.' Clinton is pictured here in 2008 taking questions from the press during the Democratic National Convention a few months before she was sworn in as Secretary of State . Clinton's former colleagues in Congress were won't to discuss the issue at all. 'Can we talk about it later? I have to go to my vote,' Clinton's successor in the Senate, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, told the National Journal. The news publication said Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, normally outspoken, excused herself for the same reason. 'I don't know enough about it to appropriately respond,' New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen said. Congressional Democrats were equally reticent to comment to CNN. 'I'm not up to speed on it. I'm really not,' Montana Sen. Jon Tester told the network on Wednesday - more than a day after story broke. 'Check back,' Tester, the chair of Senate Democrats' campaign arm, said. North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp also asked for a mulligan. 'I don't know enough about what those rules are, honestly, to comment,' she claimed. And the list goes on. West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin told National Journal he doesn't 'know the facts' but 'it sounds like somebody made a mistake.' 'She's going to have to give an answer to it,' Vermont Rep. Peter Welch told CNN. Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, the ranking member on the House's Select Committee on Benghazi, said it's not his job to protect Clinton, his party's possible nominee for president. 'I want to be clear, I am not trying to defend Hillary Clinton,' he said. 'I am trying to defend the truth … we have some things we are going to try and figure out.' If Clinton can't make the email story go away quick enough, she could go from presidential front runner in 2016 to persona non-grata. Supporters of Clintons are shown here in 2008 after she lost that year's nomination to Barack Obama . Retiring California Sen. Barbara Boxer was one of the few Democratic senators to stand by Clinton. 'That's a nothing burger. Total,' she told National Journal. 'There isn't one secretary of State that ever did that because the law didn't change until after she left, so they're making a mountain out of a molehill,' she added. Likewise, Delaware Sen. Tom Carper said he'd 'be surprised if a number of secretaries of State hadn't done that for as long as we've had email.' 'That's all I'm going to say,' he added. New York Rep. Steve Israel blamed Republicans  for the mess and accused them of 'trying to manufacture or amplify crisis or scandal.' 'That's what they do here,' he told CNN. 'Pretty soon we'll have a special investigative committee for every action that Hillary Clinton takes. There will be a special select committee on her breakfast, her lunch and her dinner and what she had in between. Just add this to the list.' It is true that Clinton's predecessors also used their personal email addresses to conduct official business. But other secretaries of state did not create private email addresses the day before their confirmation votes for the explicit purpose of communicating with their future staff. Nor did they house their email addresses on a privately owned server that is inaccessible to the government and can be wiped clean at their leisure. They weren't actively considering a bid for president, either. Reporters showered White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest with questions on Wednesday about the Clinton email controversy. The White House got a break on Thursday when a snowstorm bore down on Washington, D.C., giving Earnest cause to cancel his daily meeting with the press corps . Former Obama adviser David Axelrod said Wednesday night that he thinks the Clinton is adding to her woes by keeping silent. 'It would be good to get out there and answer these questions,' Axelrod said on MSNBC's The Last Word with Lawrence O'Donnell, according to The Hill. 'Why did she used a separate email? How did she secure that email? Was there another email through which she communicated with people?' he asked. 'By not answering these questions, they are allowing this story to fester in ways that are unhelpful. So lack of speed kills in this case,' the former White House official said. The State Department has said that Clinton had just one email address during her tenure there - the account in question. And Clinton, first through a spokesman, and then through Twitter has touched on the issue. She has not explained why she did what she did, though, or responded to any of the other questions Axelrod - and the media - put forward. A Democratic strategist who spoke to The Hill warned that if Clinton can't make the story go away quick enough, she could go from presidential front runner to persona non-grata. 'We’re probably a month or so away [from the campaign launch] and if this is not handled really well within the next three to six weeks, you’re going to see chatter among Democratic operatives saying, \"Maybe we need another person in this race.\" And that is really problematic.' 'When you do stuff like this, man, you just raise a lot of concerns and red flags,' The Hill's source said. 'It’s kinda weird.'"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "White House now claims it didn't know Clinton was solely using her personal email address to conduct government business .\nState Department wouldn't say it was 'confident' that Clinton had turned over all her emails from her tenure there .\nClinton's former Democratic colleagues in Congress were won't to discuss the issue at all .\nNew York Rep.

Around 150 officers from three forces across were involved in the raids carried out across 17 shops and residential addresses in London and Berkshire. Ten men and women were arrested as a result of the operation on Tuesday morning which followed 18 months of investigation. All but one have been bailed pending further police inquiries. Police swooped on 17 nail bars and residential addresses across the UK on Tuesday including one salon in Reading (above). Six victims of human trafficking were rescued as a result of the operation . Thames Valley Police Officers raided three nail bars in Reading, two in Wokingham and one in York in addition to a number of residential addresses. They were supported by Metropolitan Police and North Yorkshire Police as part of the operation known as Rehoboam. Investigating officer said the effort was part of an ongoing police effort to curb human trafficking in the UK. 'It is a criminal offence to traffic people into the UK. It is an offence to force people, by threats or coercion, to work unpaid or to pay off a debt. It is an offence to make people carry out acts against their will. 'The key aim of this operation is to protect vulnerable people. The victims in this investigation have been taken to rest centres where they are being supported by Thames Valley Police, the British Red Cross and the Salvation Army. 'Extra police community support officers will be out on patrol today speaking to residents and businesses to inform them of today’s operation and provide reassurance.' Ten people were arrested on suspicion of human trafficking offences as a result of the raids. Among the nail bars that were raided as part of the operation was this one in the centre of Reading (above) More than 150 officers from three different police forces were involved in the operation which saw 10 people arrested after 18 months of investigation . They are a 33-year-old woman from Berkshire; a 40-year-old man from London; a man and a woman from Wokingham aged 39 and 32 and two men and two women aged 31, 20, 33 and 24 from Reading. A 19-year-old man of no fixed address was also arrested as part of the operation. It comes after a Sunday Times report estimated around 15,000 nail bars in Britain were controlled by criminals involved in human trafficking. Between 2008 and 2013, 100 salons in England and Wales were fined a total of £700,000 for employing illegal immigrants. Some of the victims, the majority of which were Vietnamese, said they had been trafficked into the UK and forced into prostitution before taking up work in the salons. Speaking of the reported figures, Chloe Setter,  head of advocacy at ECPAT, an anti-exploitation charity, said often workers were trafficked into the salons having been involved in other illegal scenarios. 'Sometimes nail bars serve as a cover for other types of crime and some times they are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to illegality. 'But with victims working in a public facing role it's important people understand the reality of the trafficking. 'It's important for people to know this is happening on high streets and not just in murky sub-worlds. 'People are, in some cases, unwittingly using forced labour  and I think they'd be shocked to know the truth.'

But it's an issue on which this country is all over the place. \"As it relates to crimes against individuals ... the death penalty should not be expanded to instances where the victim's life was not taken.\"  That was Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing for the majority in Kennedy v. Louisiana (2008). You might think at first the Department of Justice isn't listening. After all, the U.S. federal government lists dozens of capital offenses that are punishable by death, and not all of them involve a victim's life being taken.  They fall into three main categories: 1) homicide offenses; 2) espionage and treason; and 3) nonhomicidal narcotics offenses.  While most of them involve the death of a victim, not all of them do. But what happened to all that \"shouldn't expand death penalty to crimes where the victim's life was not taken\" language from the Supreme Court?  Doesn't the Department of Justice have to listen to the Supreme Court? They do, and they have. The Department of Justice has read the high court's fine print in Kennedy v. Louisiana:  \"Our concern here is limited to crimes against individual persons. We do not address, for example, crimes defining and punishing treason, espionage, terrorism, and drug kingpin activity, which are offenses against the State. As it relates to crimes against individuals, though, the death penalty should not be expanded to instances where the victim's life was not taken.\" Ah.  As with most things, there are exceptions to the rule -- though reasonable minds may differ on the reasoning behind those exceptions. Apparently, when we are talking about crimes against people, the death penalty should not be expanded to nonhomicide-type crimes.  If it's a crime against the state, well, it's game on. After all, treason is one of three crimes mentioned in the U.S. Constitution, so there's a good argument that the federal statute authorizing death for treason is \"constitutional\" -- because it's actually in the constitution.  (Yet another reason why federal court is not a place where defendants want to be -- it's no secret defense attorneys would rather be in state court, where the penalties are less severe and where everything isn't illegal). While it varies from state to state, as a very general proposition, the death penalty is almost universally reserved for the crime of murder.  Murder is a subcategory of the broader class of homicide, and death penalty crimes are normally a subcategory of murder. As another very general proposition in the States, murder -- plus something on top that makes it more egregious -- is what will qualify as a capital crime. It would be nice to say that capital murder in the states is always defined as an intentional killing, but even that has exceptions.  In fact, in some states, you can be executed for a victim's death even if you didn't actually pull the trigger and even if you never intended a death to result. If you commit an inherently dangerous felony, and a death results, you can be charged with \"felony murder,\" which in some states qualifies you for the death penalty.  According to the Supreme Court, this is constitutional, as long as the defendant significantly participated in the felony and was recklessly indifferent to human life. Ultimately, it's nearly impossible to articulate a simple rule for determining which crimes our society deems worthy of the death penalty. Society's view of the death penalty is constantly evolving, and so is the view of appropriate death penalty crimes. As a general rule, horrific murders qualify, but sometimes a nonhomicide crime such as espionage qualifies. If you are in the armed forces, even more crimes can get you executed, such as desertion. That's particularly paradoxical that we might order our military personnel to intentionally kill in times of war and then execute them -- as was the case of Pvt. Eddie Slovik -- for refusing to intentionally participate in the killing.  Of course, we have long recognized that military justice requires a degree of martial discipline that the civilian world simply doesn't. While the husband-wife execution of convicted spies (and nonkillers) Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were certainly high profile at the time, the modern reality is that every person executed since the reinstatement of the death penalty in 1976 participated in a crime in which a victim died. So what exactly will earn you the death penalty?  The message is anything but clear. For crimes against the person, it has to be pretty awful: A killing plus something that makes it even worse than your garden variety homicide.  If your crime is against the state, however, the Supreme Court will give the state some leeway in killing citizens."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "U.S. federal government lists dozens of capital offenses punishable by death .\nDanny Cevallos: Society's view of death penalty is constantly evolving ."}]}

The three-day 'Security & Policing Event', which is closed to the public and press, has been organised by the Home Office to showcase British anti-riot kit to dozens of foreign governments, including Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Vladimir Putin's Russia . Sniper rifles, phone-hacking equipment and specialist 'sound guns' will be available to help foreign police control uprisings. Ministers have organised an arms fair to sell anti-riot equipment to foreign governments including rubber bullets, like those used by police against protesters in Sao Paulo, Brazil last year 2014 . The Government has publicised the event as a unique opportunity for arms manufacturers to market equipment 'which would be too sensitive to show in a more-open environment'. Since the Coalition came to power in 2010, £15.9million worth of export licences for crowd-control have been approved by Vince Cable's Business Department. This includes £10million of tear gas or 'anti-riot irritants', £640,000 of 'crowd-control ammunition' and £3.1million of riot shields. Much of the kit is sold to democracies like France and the US. But crowd-control supplies have also been cleared for countries on the Government's own human-rights blacklist. Nine of the countries to receive export approvals - Afghanistan, Bahrain, Colombia, Iraq, Israel, Libya, Pakistan, Russia and Saudi Arabia - feature or have featured on the Foreign Office's human rights blacklist of 'Countries of Concern' over the last five years. The figures - compiled from Government data by the Campaign Against the Arms Trade - show that goods worth £6.7m were cleared for shipping to the nine countries between 2010 and last September. Since the Coalition came to power it has signed off export licenses for anti-riot equipment to foreign regimes, including Libya under Muammar Gaddafi (left) and Valdimir Putin's Russia . Some £2.95m of tear gas was sold to Saudi Arabia and £228,000 of 'crowd-control ammunition' to Libya while Muammar Gaddafi remained in power, the Independent reported. Andrew Smith, from CAAT, told the newspaper: 'This is a sign of a system that puts arms-company profits ahead of human rights. Weapons like tear gas have an indiscriminate effect and are synonymous with internal repression. 'The Government may have revoked the licence for tear gas to Libya, but it should never have been signed in the first place. Gaddafi was a brutal tyrant from day one, and this is a reminder that acts of oppression by his regime were carried out with British support.' The government insists licences will not be granted when there is a 'clear risk' that the exports 'might be used to facilitate internal repression'. In a statement, the Business Department said: 'We rigorously examine every licence application on a case-by-case basis against internationally recognised criteria. 'Risks around human rights abuses are a key part of our assessment and we do not grant licences where there is a clear risk that it might be used for internal repression.'"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Three-day 'Security & Policing Event'  closed to the public and press .\nEvent has been organised by Home Office to showcase British anti-riot kit .\nSniper rifles, phone-hacking kit and 'sound guns' will be available to buy .\nCrowd control kit has been sold to regimes from Saudi Arabia to Russia ."}]}

Former Chelsea midfielder Lampard agreed to sign for the new Major League Soccer franchise last July and was set to join up with his new team-mates in January ahead of the new season, which starts on Sunday. The 36-year-old then joined New York's sister club Manchester City - both part of the City Football Group - on what was initially reported to be a short-term loan deal. Frank Lampard agreed to join New York City when he left Chelsea last summer . Former England international delayed move to the MLS franchise until the end of the Premier League season . Lampard joined Manchester City at the start of the season on a short-term deal . Head coach Jason Kreis says Lampard's late arrival can provide the team with a boost during the season . As it transpired, the deal at City was in fact a standalone one which, after a number of impressive performances for Manuel Pellegrini's side, was extended beyond January until the end of the Premier League season. Lampard's decision to remain in Manchester and miss the start of New York's debut MLS campaign riled supporters of the franchise, but Kreis appears to have taken the potentially exacerbating episode in his stride. 'You know, I think we could look at that from a very negative point of view and say this is going to be really difficult and we had him pencilled in one way or another,'Kreis said in an interview with Bleacher Report. Frank Lampard (wearing black, third right) poses for a picture with his New York City team-mates in February . The deal was extended until the summer after a number of impressive displays for City . Lampard will now join up with his new club in JUly, missing the first four months of the season . 'Or we can look at it from a positive point of view and say, OK, well, this means that some other guys are going to get meaningful opportunities to make significant contributions in his position for the first four or five months of the season, and you need that in our league. 'When you get to the end of the season and there's some real fatigue, injuries and suspensions, you need guys to be able to step in and not miss a beat. I think this affords us that opportunity. 'We're going to be having a player that's going to be at the top of his game, extremely fit, coming right out of a Premiership season, which hopefully will he will have another medal to put in his pocket, and we can have a really significant, positive boost in the middle of the season.'

Loic Collomb-Patton, from France, was captured dropping off the huge ledge in an effort to win one of the world's most prestigious skiing events. The Skiers Cup sees Team Europe and Team Americas compete against each other at the end of February - and this year saw Europe win the title. Freestyle skier Loic Collomb-Patton, from France, drops off a huge ledge while competing in the Skiers Cup in Switzerland at the end of February . Skiers hit speeds of more than 60mph in temperatures around minus 15 degrees, meaning one slip could result in devastating consequences. As well hidden crevasses, cliffs more than ten metres high and deep powder, the competitors also had to battle with 40mph winds. In one image Seth Morrison, the 42-year-old captain of the United States team, is captured pulling off a 30ft-long backflip making it the biggest and longest jump of the competition. Intrepid photographer David Carlier captured the athletes on camera by using a helicopter to track the skiers from above. Sverre Liliequist, from Sweden, performs a backflip on the Matterhorn against a clear blue sky. Mr Liliequist competed for Europe, which won the annual cup for the third time .

With bright yellow poles sticking out either side Logan Pehota, competing for the US, drops over a ledge into deep, powdery snow . Mr Collomb-Patton attempts the same jump but looks a little more unsteady on his feet as snow and ice tumble around him . Despite the athletes taking more than an hour in a chairlift to reach the peak of the mountain, whose summit is 4,478 metres (14,692 ft) high, they reached the bottom  in less than a minute. Mr Carlier said: 'It is very unusual to have such an amazing group of riders ski on the Matterhorn at such a high level and in such great snow conditions. 'Actually, it has never been done before as this is the first time they could ski to the bottom of the Matterhorn, just under the North face. 'It was jaw dropping to witness the size of the jumps and the speed the riders reach in virgin, untracked, deep powder snow. Mr Morrison is photographed throwing himself into the beginning of his backflip with his legs behind him. The 42-year-old regularly enters ski competitions . Nicolas Vuignier, from Switzerland, is pictured against the thick snow, which is clear aside from a few old ski runs . Mr Pehota, from Canada, tries to make his way down a near vertical cliff face.

Competitors make their way towards the peak of the Matterhorn. It takes more than an hour in a chairlift to reach the peak but less than a minute to come down . 'It requires so many skills to perform freestyle tricks in such an uncontrolled environment. 'It takes only one hour from the last lift to reach the start of the contest but then it takes them less than a minute to go down.' Nicolas Hale-Woods, freeride world tour general manager, said: 'The level of skiing is amazing – but what strikes me most is the good spirit between the teams. 'It has been really interesting to witness how the guys helped out each other. That's the spirit that makes this event so special and we will do our part to keep it that way.'

This is according to a study that found evidence of this Stone Age migration by analysing DNA of 69 people who lived across Europe between 8,000 and 3,000 years ago. Among the shifts in the genetic make-up of ancient Europeans they found that DNA associated with the Yamnaya people appeared strongly in what is now northern Germany. Researchers have identified a mass migration of Kurgan populations (Yamna culture) which went from the Russian steppes to the centre of Europe 4,500 years ago. Previously, researchers had believed it spread 8,500 years ago, when the first farmers from the Near East, now modern day Turkey, brought it to Europe . There are two main theories as to how Indo-European languages spread in Europe. The first is the Anatolian hypothesis, which claims spread of the language occurred some 8,500 years ago, when the first farmers from the Near East (currently Turkey) brought it to Europe. The Kurgan hypothesis, meanwhile, proposes that the language was spread by nomadic herders of the steppes found to the north of the Black and Caspian Sea. This theory suggests their language spread throughout Europe after the invention of wheeled vehicles, from 6,000 to 5,000 years ago. The Yamnaya were herders who lived in the steppe north of the Black and Aral Seas. This injection of DNA indicates 'a massive migration into the heartland of Europe from its eastern periphery,' said the researchers, led by David Reich of Harvard Medical School. Such a large-scale influx would likely have affected not just the DNA but ancient cultures as well. Although genes can't determine what people spoke, the researchers argue that their findings could influence the debate about the origins of Indo-European tongues. Indo-European languages include more than 400 tongues, from modern languages such as English and Polish to ancient languages like Hittite and Sanskrit. Basque, which is spoken in south-west France and northern Spain, is not Indo-European, and may be the only surviving relic of earlier languages once spoken more widely, according to the BBC. Linguists have long debated whether Indo-European languages came to Europe with farmers migrating from the Middle East or some other group, such as the Yamnaya. Previously, researchers had believed that Indo-European language spread some 8,500 years ago, when the first farmers from the Near East, now modern day Turkey, brought it to Europe. The latest study suggests that Europe was first reshaped at this time in what archaeologists call the Neolithic Revolution. Farmers from Anatolia travelled north, bringing new technology and language into Europe. This was followed by a second wave of people several thousand years later from what is today Ukraine and Russia. The latest study suggests that Europe was first reshaped during the Neolithic Revolution 8,500 years ago. Farmers at this time travelled north, bringing new technology and language into Europe. Pictured is an early Neolithic 35-40 year old male from, Czech Republic, who was part of the first mass migration to Europe . As well as genetic evidence, researchers point to the fact that many Indo-European languages share words for things like axles, harness poles, and the wheel. These devices were invented long after the Neolithic Revolution began in Europe. 'Major language replacements are thought to require large-scale migration,' said the authors of the study, which was published Monday by the journal Nature. 'Our results make a compelling case for the steppe as a source of at least some of the Indo-European languages in Europe.' Andrew Garrett, a linguist at the University of California, Berkeley, who was not involved in the study, said it was significant that the mass migration occurred at a time some models had previously identified for Indo-European expansion. 'It fills in a significant piece of a big and interesting puzzle,' said Garrett."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Study looked at DNA of Europeans who lived  8,000 and 3,000 years ago .\nDNA associated with Yamnaya people appeared in northern Germany .\nYamnaya were herders from the steppe north of the Black and Aral Seas .\nThis suggests a large influx that would have changed speech and DNA .\nPreviously, researchers believed that Indo-European language spread some 8,500 years ago, by the first farmers from the Near East, now Turkey ."}]}

The March/April edition of the Lego Club Magazine included a feature called 'Emma's Beauty Tips', which suggested that young girls who are 'ready to change up their looks' should consider opting for a more flattering haircut that would better suit their face shape. 'You, yes you, are beautiful, but if you're ready to change up your look, read on for some tips and tricks on how to get the best haircut for the shape of your face,' the article reads. Outrage: This 'beauty tips' feature in the March/April edition of the Lego Club Magazine has caused fury among parents . The feature then lists five different face shapes, from 'heart faces' to 'oval faces', suggesting which type of hair cut would be bested suited to each shape. And while those with heart-shaped faces are advised to choose 'long, curly layers and thinned out curls' in order to accentuate their 'angular cheeks', those with oval faces are told that they are lucky enough to be able to 'have almost any style haircut' because 'almost everything looks great on this face shape'. Unsurprisingly, the article has hit a nerve with parents of the young girls reading the magazine - with one mother, Cleveland-based writer Sharon Holbrook, writing a piece for the New York Times slamming the magazine's 'insulting' feature. '[My daughter] is seven,' she wrote. 'My little girl, the shape of her face, and whether her haircut is flattering are none of Lego’s concern,'  It wasn’t even her concern until a toy magazine told her to start worrying about it.' Mrs Holbrook goes on to quote from the Lego Friends website, which states that the range is aimed at children between the ages of five and 12 who are, she writes, 'far too young' to be told that their face shape might mean they need a new haircut in order to 'soften the edges' of their faces. Unnecessary: The 'overtly girly' Lego Friends line, including this Heartlake Hair Salon, has previously come under fire from parents for suggesting that young girls should not be playing with traditional Lego models . Calling for change: Writer Sharon Holbrook (pictured) wrote a piece about the Lego feature in which she insisted that children as young as five should not be worrying about whether they have a flattering face shape . The online article has prompted a flurry of furious activity on social media, with parents across the country calling for Lego to abandon its 'sexist' marketing campaigns and 'overtly girly' toy ranges in favor of returning to the 'powerful messages' it once offered to  young girls who were so eager to play with their products. 'Go back to this [message] of 1981 instead of \"beauty tips for 5-12 year-olds\" c**p,' one person wrote on Twitter, alongside a picture of a 30-year-old Lego ad campaign which encouraged young girls to 'build for fun'. Another added: 'Nonononono. Damn it, LEGO. Girls don't need another source of beauty tips, let alone from you.' One parent went as far as to say she would boycott Lego until the brand does something to address its 'sexist' campaigns, tweeting: 'Hey @LEGO_Group, your sexism is getting out of control. I’m buying @Tegu blocks until you check it (sic).' 'The ultra-girly Lego Friends line caused a flap from the beginning, and I wasn’t at all sure whether I liked it,' Mrs Holbrook added. 'Why can’t girls and boys both play with traditional Legos? When I was little, Lego used to even market them to all children, magnificently so...' Go back: Parents are calling for Lego to return to the positive messages it once sent out to young girls, such as the one in this ad campaign from 1981 . Fury: Many parents have taken to social media to express their outrage and disappointment at the overtly 'sexist' Lego Friends line . In a statement provided to Mashable, Lego spokesman Michael McNally insisted that the copmany was taking onboard all of the feedback offered by 'readers', adding that the brand 'sincerely regrets' any offense caused by the feature. 'Our Club team is always striving for new ways to engage with Lego fans based on insights we gather from our Club audience,' Mr McNally said. 'One particular thing that readers asked us to include was an \"Advice Column\". In the most recent magazine, we attempted to deliver against this request by elaborating on a current Lego Friends story line. 'We sincerely regret any disappointment it may have caused. We value this feedback and have already shared with the Lego Club team in order to positively impact future stories.' It is not the first time that the Lego Friends line, the range of toys on which the beauty tips article was based, has come under heavy criticism from parents. Shortly after the range debuted in 2011, many people spoke out to express concern about its seemingly sexist suggestion that young girls needed their own line of feminine toys, rather than being able to play with the traditional building blocks also used by boys. Instead of the more conventional themes many associate with Lego blocks, the Lego Friends line focuses on shopping, beauty products, homemaking and cooking."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The March/April edition of the Lego Club Magazine included a feature on how young girls could change their hairstyles to be more flattering .\nParents are now threatening to boycott the toy brand over the 'disgraceful' article ."}]}

It was just what you did when you have children - you do what your doctor tells you, because they know best. My husband and I had never been told that there could be any adverse reactions, only a bit of redness and swelling at the injection site. So as each of our six eldest children got progressively sicker after each vaccination, we never made that connection. Out of our six vaccinated children, our 16, 12 and 10-year-old have moderate to severe Autism, our 25-year-old has ADHD, our 14-year-old has a severe language disorder, and our 20-year-old has severe mood swings. Tasha David (back right) tells how she chose to not vaccinate her two youngest children Sasa, eight (front left), and Chiante, five (front middle) after her first SIX (back row L-R: Asante, 16, Jourdahn, 25, middle row L-R: Deveraux, 20, Sahara, 14, Acacia, 10, Armaan, 12) suffered health problems . They also suffered from chronic ear infections, bronchiolitis, asthma, eczema, psoriasis, urinary infections, gastrointestinal and autoimmune disorders, allergies, chemical sensitivities and intolerances. We tried genetic testing to look for answers, but no reason was found for our children’s afflictions. So I started looking for answers on my own. I read books, went to seminars, read all the scientific studies I could get my hands on and that’s when I discovered that our family was not the only one. There were many other families suffering from the same issues as ours. 'Out of our six vaccinated children, our 16, 12 and 10-year-old have moderate to severe Autism, our 25-year-old has ADHD, our 14-year-old has a severe language disorder, and our 20-year-old has severe mood swings' Fighting fit: Tasha says her two youngest children have 'thrived' and have never been sick . This realization led us to not vaccinate our five and eight-year-old old and they have thrived because of it. Out of all their siblings they should have been the most susceptible to genetic problems considering that I was in my late thirties when I had them and was overweight. Yet our two youngest never had to suffer through the many illnesses that their brothers and sisters did. Not because they had never been exposed to illness because like all preschool and school children, they had been. But they had a resilience that had been taken from their siblings. They have never had or needed an antibiotic in their lives, but more importantly they had none of their sibling’s disorders. This was an especially bitter sweet realisation for me, as I looked at them and realised just how much my other children had lost because of me. I had to come to terms with the fact that my ignorance about what I allowed to be put in to my children’s bodies had caused at least two (possibly three) of my children to NEVER be able to have the chance to be independent, fall in love and have a family. That when I die, they face the possibility of living with strangers who don’t love them the way they deserve to be loved. 'They have never had or needed an antibiotic in their lives': David's youngest, Chiante, five, and Sasa, eight, are healthy . People need to realise that vaccination is not one size fits all, that there are families in your community that are struggling with the harm that vaccines have caused. Have we so quickly forgotten Saba Button,  Lachlan Neylan [both toddlers were left severely disabled following flu shots in 2010 and 2012, respectively], and Ashley Epapara? [who died a day after receiving a flu shot in 2010] This is why vaccination must always remain a choice - otherwise we are saying that some children matter more than others. This issue has been thrown in to the spotlight once again by the tragic loss of four week old Riley Hughes to Whooping Cough. My heart goes out to this family - no parent should ever have to suffer through the death of their child. Unfortunately a few journalists have seized on this tragedy to create more hatred and animosity towards innocent children and their families. They are recklessly setting parents against each other and in the process they are doing a great disservice to this family and to the other families that are not aware of the shortcomings of this vaccine. In 2009 a fully vaccinated nurse is suspected to have infected four infants with Whooping cough in a maternity ward in Sydney, as well as several studies since then that show that this vaccine is not providing the protection that our children deserve. Tragic: Riley Hughes died at just 32 days old after suffering complications arising from whooping cough . In 1991 we had a 71 per cent vaccination rate for Whooping Cough, yet there were only 347 cases, but in 2011 with a vaccination rate of over 92 per cent, we had over 38,000 cases. How can the unvaccinated be to blame? Pregnant women need to be aware that vaccine product inserts say that the effect of this vaccine on the development of the embryo and foetus has not been assessed. Vaccination in pregnancy is not recommended unless there is a definite risk of acquiring pertussis. The attacking of parents whether they vaccinate or not needs to stop, because at the end of the day we all love our children dearly, and we all want what is best for them and for all children. Divisiveness is not the answer and it never will be, we will only find real solutions when the fighting stops and open discussion begins.
