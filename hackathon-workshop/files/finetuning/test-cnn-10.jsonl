Trott, England’s rock at No 3 for four years before his early return home from the 2013-14 Ashes series in Australia with a stress-related condition, was picked for this three-Test tour of the Caribbean after fighting his way back into contention. All the talk before the team’s departure may have been about Kevin Pietersen but the real focus of this tour is likely to fall on another South African-born batsman in Trott. Jonathan Trott during a nets session as he returned to the international scene and could be ready to play . The 33-year-old has been impressive in not only addressing the personal demons which led to his departure from Brisbane but also scoring the weight of runs needed to demand a recall. Alastair Cook knows the value an in-form Trott would bring to his side’s chances of recording a series win in the Caribbean that is vital not only for his own future as Test captain but that of coach Peter Moores, whose job security is at perilous levels. Cook admits England will not be totally sure if Trott can handle the mental demands of international cricket until he is pitched into the heat of battle again.But he is likely to be given the chance to re-establish himself in the team, this time as Cook’s opening partner, during the two warm-up matches against a St Kitts & Nevis Invitation XI this week. Test captain Alastair Cook feels the batsman is ready for international cricket return . Trott (left) and Cook train together during a batting session at Warner Park, Basseterre, St Kitts & Nevis . The first of those two-day encounters starts here tomorrow and if Trott can show the same form he displayed during the England Lions tour of South Africa earlier this year then he looks certain to see off the challenge of Yorkshire opener Adam Lyth and make his 50th Test appearance in Antigua a week tomorrow. ‘I am confident he can handle it,’ Cook said. ‘You don’t know 100 per cent until he’s put out in the environment. There are a lot of things about selection that are unknown until you’re put into the pressure cooker of international cricket and make no mistake, it’s a high-intensity environment. ‘But what we do know is he’s a quality player.’ The Warwickshire batsman has been in fine form for them and rightly deserved his call-up .

But there's the potential for things to get a little awkward when the conversation turns from \"hi\"s to highs. \"There's always a moment of hesitation of 'when are they going to ask us what we do?' and 'how are they going to receive that when we tell them?'\" McGuire, 25, said. She and Rogers, 34, own the Breckenridge Cannabis Club, a recreational marijuana dispensary in the historic and scenic ski town of Breckenridge, Colorado. The couple started their business as a medical cannabis dispensary in 2010, but when Colorado became the first state in the nation to allow the sale of recreational marijuana, they saw a once-in-a-lifetime business opportunity. Previously, they were only permitted to sell medical marijuana to the approximate 4,500 permanent residents of Breckenridge; when the new legislation took effect on January 1, 2014, they could then sell to any of the 30,000-plus tourists (21 years or older) who visited the town during peak season. By the end of the first day of \"recreational\" sales, they knew their lives had changed forever. The two said they brought in more than $47,000 in sales, roughly 30 times their normal daily sales of medical marijuana. The long lines and enthusiastic patrons also raised the ire of some of the residents who felt the shop detracted from the town's \"family-friendly\" atmosphere . Now, the pair's journey to build a legal marijuana empire is documented in the new CNN Original Series \"High Profits,\" which premieres Sunday, April 19, at 10 p.m. ET/PT. \"Somebody is going to become a mogul,\" Rogers said. In 2014, legal marijuana was a $700 million industry in Colorado and was billed as the fastest growing industry in the United States.  And, according to a a 2014 Gallup Poll, 51% of Americans favored legalizing marijuana, though that was down from the previous year's approval of 58%. It's a majority, but a slim majority -- and 23 states still prohibit marijuana outright. Here are the next states to legalize pot . \"We want to show people that it's not just a bunch of stoners selling pot over the counter,\" McGuire said. \"It's business-minded people -- hardworking Americans -- who are just like any other business and trying to make their dream work.\" She and Rogers are simultaneously pragmatic and optimistic about the public's opinion. It's 2015: Is weed legal in your state? \"I think they often think we woke up and it was handed to us. Our job was created; we created our jobs through hard work and investment and risk,\" Rogers said. As pioneers in a newly legalized business, the risks Rogers and McGuire face go above and beyond those of your average small business. While the sale and private consumption of cannabis is legal in Colorado, the federal government still considers it a Schedule I controlled substance like heroin or LSD, a dangerous drug with \"no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.\" That classification makes it difficult for banks -- which are federally regulated -- to do business with marijuana retailers, even legal ones. Few even try. This is pot's $3 billion banking problem . And forget about paying for your pot with plastic. Like most Colorado cannabis stores, the Breckenridge Cannabis Club is a cash only business. Without access to banking, McGuire and Rogers are forced to pay their staff, their suppliers and even their taxes in cash. The two recognize that \"budtender\" might not be a career path any family expects their child to embark on, but for the most part, there has been surprising support: McGuire even got permission to use the remainder of her college fund to start Breckenridge Cannabis Club more than five years ago. \"For both of us, it was pretty easy to see this as a great opportunity to do something different,\" McGuire said. \"We were just working in the service industry so it's not like either of us had any full-fledged careers that we were afraid to leave behind or families that we were worried about risking or providing for.\" What's worse -- pot or booze? Rogers' family used to tell his grandmother that he and McGuire ran a ski rental business. \"Then one day she was like, 'You don't rent skis, do you?'\" he laughs. McGuire had a similar experience with her grandma, until she came to the store for the first time and saw its legitimacy. \"She thought we were just your stereotypical drug dealers,\" she said. The couple says their grandmothers' attitude shift is what they're hoping for on a larger scale: While you may not agree with them, entrepreneurs in four states and the District of Columbia are out to prove that recreational cannabis and capitalism can coexist. \"We're cannabis consumers and we support that part of it, too. But that's not what this business is about,\" McGuire said. \"It's about having the opportunity to create a life for us and have a professional career that sustains us.\" Will they succeed?

Summer Elbardissy was partying at the Beta Theta Pi fraternity house at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut, last year when she reportedly tried to reach a makeshift roof deck. But instead of making it onto the deck, where students often gathered, she fell out of a third-story window, according to newly-released police reports and a lawsuit filed in the city's Superior Court. Moments later, another teenager heard what 'sounded like a thud hitting the ground'. Miss Elbardissy was discovered lying unconscious on the floor, with her face covered in blood.

Frat house: The 19-year-old was reportedly partying at the Beta Theta Pi fraternity house (pictured) at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut, last year when she tried to reach a makeshift roof desk . The intoxicated sophomore was rushed to St Francis Hospital with serious injuries, including a brain injury and swelling, a broken skull and pelvis, and lung bruising, the Hartford Courant reported. She was forced to undergo intubation and had to relearn how to walk, according to a GoFundMe page that was set up by  Miss Elbardissy's mother, Inas Morsi, after last September's accident. She also had to be taught by a therapist how to swallow food, brush her teeth, get dressed and wash herself, it is reported. Seven months on, she is apparently still recovering from the fall. On the fundraising page, which has raised more than $44,000 for the teenager, Ms Morsi has described her daughter as a 'fighter', adding: 'this is just another battle that she will overcome.' In November, she wrote: 'This is a special Thanksgiving for our family. We are thankful for so many things. We are especially thankful for all of the support you have shown us for Summer.' And Miss Elbardissy herself appears to be in good spirits - over the past few months, she has posted smiling photos and positive messages on her Facebook and Instagram pages on a regular basis.

Sophomore: Miss Elbardissy (pictured, left and right, in Facebook photos) was rushed to St Francis Hospital with serious injuries, including brain swelling, a broken skull, hip and pelvis and bruising on her lung . The fall was not the first notable incident to have occurred at Beta Theta Pi, which is not recognized by Wesleyan University as a fraternity and was once dubbed 'the rape factory' in a lawsuit. In 2010, a student alleged that she was sexually assaulted at the fraternity house, while another claimed to have been raped by a non-student on the premises in 2013, according to WFSB. In Miss Elbardissy's case, police were apparently already at the house investigating a noise complaint when she fell. They were alerted to her fate at around 1.15am on September 7. Miss Elbardissy was reportedly drunk at the time. As the officers waited for medics to arrive at the scene, they had beer poured over them out of a window by fraternity members, it is alleged. Fall: She was forced to undergo intubation and had to relearn how to walk, swallow food and get dressed, it is reported. Above, a clip from a news report at the time. Miss Elbardissy fell out of one of these windows . 'A really nice girl': The fall was not the first notable incident to have occurred at Beta Theta Pi, which is not recognized by Wesleyan University as a fraternity. Above,  Miss Elbardissy is seen in a Facebook photo . Following the incident, Wesleyan ordered students to stay away from the fraternity house, saying it had 'lost confidence in the ability of the fraternity members to manage social activities at the house'. Meanwhile, the national Beta Theta Pi fraternity suspended the Wesleyan Mu Epsilon chapter. It is believed that the fraternity is still out of bounds for students at the private liberal arts college. Now, Miss Elbardissy has filed a lawsuit against the fraternity and Wesleyan via her lawyer. The 24-page document accuses the university of failing to protect her from the dangers at the frat house. It alleges the college turned a blind eye to a number of safety violations at the house - including the roof deck, which the fraternity used 'openly and obviously' - despite warnings from city officials, .

What a perfect game to represent such an absurd season. Bournemouth were out of it. Then they were in it. Then it all went bonkers and Eddie Howe was caught between feelings of regret and unhappiness with Paul Tierney, the referee. The stripped-down fact is that it finished 2-2. The glorious detail is that Bournemouth trailed to a Kieran Lee sucker punch, levelled through Yann Kermorgant and then had a man sent off. A problem? Not really.

Matt Ritchie scored the kind of goal that belongs in the Premier League to put them in front. Job done? Not nearly. Chris Maguire scored a penalty for Wednesday deep into stoppage time and three point became one; a big step towards the top flight became a stumble. Howe was left 'heartbroken', but also frustrated, not least because he felt Callum Wilson deserved a penalty in the second half when he appeared to be fouled by Lewis Buxton. Bournemouth have had 15 penalties this season and Howe suggested that might be counting against them, saying in a radio interview: 'It looked like the referees have come together and talked about Callum Wilson and said don’t give him any penalties because Bournemouth have had too many this season and we don’ t want them to have any more.' His broader disappointment was also clear, having blown a major opportunity to keep top spot in a thrilling division. He said: 'It really is tough to take. That is why we love the game – the drama and twists and turns. 'The pain and frustration we need to transfer into motivation. This is our most successful season but we have had low moments. We have only two games and our objective is clear. We have to use this as motivation to move forward now. We have to respond.' Lee had put Wednesday in front with a 36th-minute header before Kermorgant levelled midway through the second half. A draw at that stage might have seemed fair but Simon Francis was sent off for two yellow cards and Bournemouth were back on the ropes. Cue bedlam. Ritchie launched a shot into the top corner after Andrew Surman laid off a free-kick but Maguire added to the madness in stoppage time. Wednesday manager Stuart Grey couldn't help but chuckle. He said: 'It took six and a half hours to get down here but we got on with it. If we left without anything it would have been disappointing.'

Today, Brad Pitt is known the world over. Ivana Chubbuck's client list includes Eva Mendes, Charlize Theron, Gerard Butler, Halle Berry, Sharon Stone and many others. So powerful are her methods, she reduced Beyoncé Knowles to tears within five minutes. And within months, the singer was topping the charts with Single Ladies. Part therapist, part acting coach, and very Hollywood, Chubbuck, 62, runs a hugely successful drama school in Los Angeles. She hosts workshops around the globe, as well as in the wood-panelled library of her £3 million home. Beyoncé went to Chubbuck when she was about to play legendary soul singer Etta James in the movie Cadillac Records and was looking to be taken seriously as an artist. Despite her professional success, Beyoncé was also at what she termed 'a pivotal point' in her life. 'I'm about empowering people,' Chubbuck told The Mail on Sunday in a rare interview – one which goes much further into her methods, and her clients' responses, than she usually allows. 'Beyoncé is a black girl from the South, that is her world. Like everyone else on the planet, she has issues. But once she faced those issues and realised she could use them in a positive way in her art, she flourished.' Apparently it's all about the 'secret stuff' that Chubbuck's clients tell her. Certainly it is well known that Beyoncé's relationship with her domineering father has been fractured for years. 'I told her to open up, to really get in touch with her feelings and what was going on inside her,' Chubbuck said. 'She started to feel her secret stuff and we start having a dialogue about it and she became emotional. We were crying together. She tapped into that well of pain inside her. 'She rang me up after we'd worked together on the movie and said, 'Listen to my new record – it's all the stuff you taught me.' And that's when she came out with Single Ladies and all the great female empowerment songs. The little pop star turned into a global icon.' When we meet at Chubbuck's home, model and actress Eva Mendes is just leaving after a three-hour 'intensive session' for her new movie with Ricky Gervais called Special Correspondents. Clients: Chubbuck works with some of the biggest names in show business including Beyonce (left) and Eva Mendes (right) Eva's Prada dress in pale orange . Shop the designer at Saks Fifth Avenue! Visit site . Esmeralda! We LOVE it. And we've a feeling little Esmeralda might be a little style icon in the making, just like her mum. So what that in mind, it's time to revisit one of our favourite Eva Mendes looks. This woman can wear what she likes. Even in bold shades of orange she still manages to look flawless, which is why we've decided to take some autumnal inspiration from this premiere perfect look. She wore this orange Prada dress back in March of 2013, but we still can't quite get over it. It's floaty, feminine and gorgeous. Eva teamed this orange number with a lighter hue satin shoe, which added another texture and dimension to the look. We would definitely suggest a strappy, metallic heel with this. So, if you're keen to update her look for the new season, check out our pick of the best colour-popping dresses (below).

Bec & Bridge Isis Angle Dress (now on sale for $178!) at Revolve . Visit site . Carven Crêpe de Chine Dress at Barneys . Visit site . So what did that amount to? Mendes said: 'Ivana's technique could be boiled down to: take the pain in your life and find the most effective way to accomplish a goal with it.' In other words, your guess is as good as mine. Mendes continues: 'It helps you understand humanity – what drives someone to do what they do, good or bad. It's not painful… it's cathartic.' Chubbuck first met Brad Pitt when he was working as a promoter for a fast-food restaurant dressed in a chicken suit, and tells a story of a young man so driven by a desire to succeed that he had no life aside from acting. Today, he is still a client and Chubbuck worked on his most recent movie, Fury. She made an icon out of Brad Pitt, who when she met him was working as a promoter at a fast-food restaurant dressed in a chicken suit . 'Brad always had a work ethic that put others to shame,' Chubbuck said. 'He studied and worked. I would pair him up with a partner and many of those partners would ask to be changed because Brad wanted to rehearse a scene three, four, five hours a day. He was dedicated to his craft. He had no social life. He had his stupid job and the rest of the time he was studying with me. 'For the major talents, fame is never the driving force. Brad worked his butt off, he's taken risks over the years and when he fails he gets back up and works harder. He makes bold choices and isn't afraid to fail.' So what is the secret? Chubbuck says her technique is based on delving into your 'deepest, darkest past' and then using those negative feelings to positively portray a character on screen. Some of this is outlined in a best-selling book The Power Of The Actor (Gotham Books) which has been translated into 18 languages. Stars such as Kate Bosworth, Camilla Belle, Elisabeth Shue and Mendes have given the tome glowing reviews. Mendes said: 'It is my bible – I don't leave home without it.' Chubbuck recently returned from a working trip to London and says the phenomenon of British actors dominating Hollywood (Eddie Redmayne, Benedict Cumberbatch, Daniel Craig) is 'because Brits have a great work ethic and are not afraid to take risks or make fun of themselves'. Do her celebrity friends such as Matthew Perry, James Franco and Jake Gyllenhaal ever expect star treatment? 'Bottom line is they are with me to work,' Chubbuck says. 'Celebrity goes out the window. I'm about stripping them bare. The one thing I have learned over the years is that all of us have the same needs and wants as human beings. 'It doesn't matter if you are in London or the Philippines. There's a shared human story – we all want love, we all have issues with our spouses or partners, with our parents. The key thing is taking the bad stuff and not being a victim. 'You have to use that stuff to empower yourself.'"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Ivana Chubbuck, 62, is known as the 'celebrity whisperer' and hones talent .\nShe's a therapist and acting coach and runs a drama school in Los Angeles .\nChubbuck counts Beyoncé, Eva Mendes and Brad Pitt among her clients ."}]}

And now a study has claimed that we could create our own auroras, by firing a particle accelerator into the sky from space. The intriguing research says that a beam fired from the machine would create artificial auroras  – and it could even create lightning in the atmosphere. Scientists in California have described how to create artificial auroras on Earth. They said a particle accelerator could be sent 185 miles (300km) up into space (illustration of a satellite in orbit shown). It would then fire high-energy beams back at Earth's atmosphere . The study, published in the Journal of Geophysical Research, was picked up by Mark Zastrow from Eos. The accelerator being proposed would be three times stronger than anything like it before, producing a beam with particles 0.5 to 10 million electron volts. Pulses of the beam would last just 0.1 microseconds. The accelerator would be located in space, 185 miles (300km) above the ground, and would fire back towards Earth's atmosphere. There are two types of auroras on Earth - the Aurora Borealis in the Northern Hemisphere, known as the Northern Lights, and the Aurora Australis in the Southern Hemisphere, known as the Southern Lights. Auroras occur when highly charged electrons from the solar wind collide with atoms of oxygen and nitrogen in the earth's atmosphere at altitudes from 20 to 200 miles (32 to 320km) above the planet’s surface. The interactions between the charged particles give off light. Auroral displays appear in many colours: red, yellow, green, blue, and violet. The color of the aurora depends on which atom is struck, and the altitude of the meeting. The common green hue is caused by colliding oxygen molecules at altitudes of up to 150 miles (240km). It would be based on a instrument called the Compact Particle Accelerator for Space Science (Compass), which is being developed by the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and SRI International, both in California. ‘The authors say that employing such instrumentation would offer many scientific opportunities to study the behaviour of particles in the upper atmosphere,’ wrote Mr Zastrow. ‘The paths of the electrons would trace out the arcing field lines of Earth’s magnetic field, illustrating how they bend and snap during the intense geomagnetic activity caused by solar storms. ‘As they descend into the Earth’s atmosphere, some of the electrons would strike atmospheric molecules, producing visible aurora-like emission.’ He added that the beam might even be able to trigger different forms of lightning, including red sprites and blue jets. For now the idea is only a concept, and there are no concrete plans to build it. But the team says that by proving it works, it could be a step towards actually making it. There are two types of auroras on Earth - the Aurora Borealis in the Northern Hemisphere, known as the Northern Lights, and the Aurora Australis in the Southern Hemisphere, known as the Southern Lights. Shown is the Aurora Borealis above the Snaefellsnes Peninsula in Iceland . It would not be the first experiment with Earth’s atmosphere, though. In Alaska there is an ionospheric research programmed called the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program (Haarp). Haarp is jointly funded by the US Air Force, the US Navy, the University of Alaska, and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa). It was established to analyse the ionosphere - a region of the upper atmosphere - and investigate the development of ionospheric enhancement technology for radio communications and surveillance. In Alaska there is already an ionospheric research programmed called the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program (Haarp), pictured. It was established to analyse the ionosphere - a region of the upper atmosphere - and investigate the development of ionospheric enhancement technology . The station regularly uses a tool called the Ionospheric Research Instrument (IRI), a high-power radio frequency transmitter facility operating in the high frequency band. It is used to temporarily excite a limited area of the Ionosphere. Haarp has been the subject of numerous unfounded conspiracy theories. It has been blamed for hurricanes, thunderstorms, major power outages and more, but no convincing evidence supports any of the claims."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Scientists in California described how to create artificial auroras on Earth .\nThey said a particle accelerator could be sent 185 miles up into space .\nIt would then fire high-energy beams back at Earth's atmosphere .\nThis would create auroras to study - and even types of lightning ."}]}

The Christian Dior fragrance, Eau Savage, was the first to use it in 1966, and it has since found its way into other fragrances such as Chamade by Guerlain, CKOne, Paco by Paco Rabane and Chanel no. 19. The latest study shows how Hedione - which has the chemical name methyl dihydro-jasmonate - activates the pheromone receptor VN1R in humans. This activates part of the hypothalamus - an area of the brain responsible for triggering the release of sex hormones in women. Hedione - derived from the Greek word 'hedone', for fun, pleasure, lust - has a fresh jasmine-magnolia scent. The Christian Dior fragrance, Eau Savage, was the first to use it in 1966, and it has since found its way into other fragrances such as Chamade by Guerlain, CKOne and Chanel no. 19. The study found that Hedione creates 'sex-specific activation patterns' in the tissue found in the nasal cavity which connects to the brain, according to a report in the Telegraph. Here Hedione - which has the chemical name methyl dihydro-jasmonate - activates the pheromone receptor VN1R in humans. 'These results constitute compelling evidence that a pheromone effect different from normal olfactory perception indeed exists in humans,' says scent researcher Prof Hanns Hatt from Ruhr-Universität Bochum in Germany. Scientists analysed brain activity when a person smelled Hedione to find out how it changed their emotions and behaviour. They then compared the results with the effects caused by a common floral fragrance known as phenylethyl alcohol. Hedione triggered brain areas in the limbic system, which is responsible for emotions, memory and motivation, more effectively than phenylethyl alcohol. It also activated an area of the hypothalamus which releases sex hormones throughout body to turn people on.

But scientists are still divided over whether humans can actually communicate via pheromones. In the animal kingdom, this kind of communication is widespread. Mice have around 300 different genes for pheromone receptors; in humans, probably only five of them are still functional. 'In the next stage, we want to find out which physiological and psychological parameters are affected when Hedione activates the pheromone receptor,' explains Hanns Hatt. 'We also have to search for scent molecules in bodily secretions, which resemble Hedione and activate the receptor. 'With its help, humans could actually communicate with each other.'"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Actor was famous for wearing Christian Dior's Eau Sauvage aftershave .\nIt contained Hedion, a chemical that activates the brain's hypothalamus .\nRegion is responsible for triggering release of sex hormones in women ."}]}

More than 10,000 have not survived. But for those who have survived, life will never be the same. And even for those who did not experience Ebola personally, the \"most severe public health emergency seen in modern times\" showed the world its vulnerability to disease. It revealed real flaws in government systems that are supposed to protect us. While the intensity of the largest Ebola epidemic in history has died down, and the initial dire predictions that there would be over a million infections by January never came true, dozens are still newly infected each week. The latest World Health Organization Report confirmed a total of 30 new confirmed cases of Ebola were reported in the week of April 5. This is the lowest weekly total since May 2014. But reports are mixed on stopping the virus completely: In Liberia and Sierra Leone, the number of cases has fallen so much, there are more treatment facilities than demand. WHO in Liberia is in the process of decommissioning surplus facilities. But in Guinea, of the 19 confirmed deaths from April 5, seven were only identified as Ebola post-mortem and there were reports of 21 unsafe burials. \"Taken together these data indicate that though surveillance is improving, unknown chains of transmission could be a source of new infections in the coming weeks,\" the latest WHO report said.
