Make that the file size does not exceed 10 MB and contains no more than 20K tokens. A token is considered to be a unit of text, such as a word, sub-word, number, or symbol, that is processed as a single entity. Due to the preset ingestion token limit, it is recommended to use a file under 10MB. However, a text-heavy file, that is much smaller than 10MB, can potentially breach the token limit."
