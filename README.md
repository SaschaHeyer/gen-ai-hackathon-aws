# Generative AI Hackathon on AWS

Welcome to the **Generative AI Hackathon on AWS**! This repository contains all the resources, files, and notebooks you'll need to get started with AWS Bedrock and other AI tools.


## Introduction

This hackathon focuses on leveraging AWS Bedrock to build and deploy generative AI models. Throughout this hackathon, you'll explore various aspects of generative AI, including controlled generation, fine-tuning, multimodal AI, and more.

## Setup

To get started, you'll need to set up your environment. Ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- AWS CLI configured with your credentials
- Necessary Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)

Install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
